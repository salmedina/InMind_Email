Wes, we have the following dates set up:
 a) East Midstream and QF Restructuring - Aug 15;
 b) Industrials - Aug 14;
 c) Canada Origination - Aug 16;
 d) West Midstream - Aug 17;
 e) HPL, LRC and Upstream Origination - Aug 28.

We are setting up the remainder as we speak.  I have some final comments on 
the packages you gave me; however, the color printing will not fax so we need 
to find time to discuss.

Please fax the Friday "package" and the final Q2 numbers.

Regards
Delainey

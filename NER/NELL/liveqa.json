Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.\nBoard certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.\nDr. Nyberg is Board Certified in:\nDiagnostic Radiology\nAccrediting Board: American Board of Radiology *\nNeuroradiology\nAccrediting Board: American Board of Radiology *\n* This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.

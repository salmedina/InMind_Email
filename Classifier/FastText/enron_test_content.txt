We need a name for the LLC for this transaction.  Any suggestions?  Kay
I think it looks good.  a few suggestions though:  I haven't read the whole reprt so I can't say for sure that it alleges no  price gouging (make sure to forward this to Jeff ... my e-mail is slow on the  road).  We can say though, that instead of blaming generators and marketers  the report blames the structure of the market for California's woes.  I think we should shorten the quote to something like " the reprt is  consistent with what we have said all along.  We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will "penalize  utilities for underscheduling" not predicting.  Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting  people from wild price swings ... that's what allowing utilities to buy  outside the spot should help do.

Dan Watkiss argues that FERC has no authority to override the state, even  though the rules go far beyond what is critical or necessary.   Per Christi's thoughts, we may want to gauge Congressional interest in  pushing something as an add-on to EPAct '92 that allows only safety / public  interest reasons for an EWG to be restricted in its siting by a State.  Jim  ---------------------- Forwarded by James D Steffes/NA/Enron on 04/19/2001  06:58 PM ---------------------------   cc:    Subject: Re: FLORIDA Matters  I talked with Dan briefly about this to verify my conclusion that FERC would  not get involved at this point.  The Florida issue seems similar to  California (or any other state that has idiosyncratic siting issues) in that  FERC has encouraged California to speed the siting of generation, but has not  ordered it.  What I am not sure about is whether the possible DOE or  Congressional emergency electricity legislation that Jim sent out yesterday  (on demand side management payments) could also include language that would  allow the federal government to override the certain state generation siting  issues, such as the Florida law. ---------------------- Forwarded by Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT on 04/19/2001  08:59 AM ---------------------------   "Dan Watkiss" <dwatkiss@bracepatt.com> on 04/19/2001 08:15:45 AM  cc:    Subject: Re: FLORIDA Matters   Christi, the Florida certificate process controls siting and licensing of  generators.

What is the process post the FL Supreme Court decision.  Did anyone appeal to the Federal Courts?  Outcome of that action, if taken?  2.   Is it possible for the FERC to simply act to waive the CCN need?  Did we ever discuss with FERC counsel the ability for that agency to "override" the CCN for any filing EWG?  What would they need to do?  Would FERC need to take on the FPSC or Fla Supreme Court?  A state should have the right to worry about safety and reliability, but not interfere with wholesale competition.  3.   Have we calculated a "back of the envelope" $ value for the margin the Utilities (FPL, TECO, FPC) will obtain by transferring generation at book? I would think that nuke should be at book (this is a gimme) with the fossil analyzed as the difference between average book ($/kw) and market value ($/kw - see Ben Jacoby).  What is the total $?  My understanding is that Steve Kean is heading into Florida to meet with Sect of Environment next week.  We need to try and get a read from the Utilities on how much $ would they be willing to give back in rate decreases as a Generation Stranded Benefit to see this deal through before the meeting.  Thanks,  Jim

For your information, CTS (CalPX Trading Services) will be hosting a  conference call on Wednesday, October 25, 2000 @ 1130 PST to discuss the recent introduction of ISO Super-Peak contracts.  These contracts, which are  available for daily day-of trading from 5 AM - 8 AM on weekdays, provide customers with  an opportunity to sell hourly blocks of energy directly to the CAISO.  Because  the scheduling and settlement of these contracts takes place directly between the ISO and its counterparties, these procedures are outside the normal CTS parameters and are subject to unique requirements.  This call will provide customers with details of such procedures and requirements.   Date:          Wednesday, October 25, 2000  Time:          11:30 PST  Call in:       888-452-9851  Password: Super Peak  Leader:        Cleo Center  We look forward to your participation on this call.  If you have any questions, please contact your Client Executive.

Dear Vince,   Hi, I hope your having fun on you vacation!  I just want to drop you a line  since we haven't talked in a while and give you a progress update.  First, I  feeling much better.  Eventhough I was out last week, I finished the  following curves:    Canadian CPI Phillippines FX and CPI Mexican FX and CPI Saudi Arabian FX and CPI Guatemalan FX  We also helped London RAC with finding information on the UK inflation model  to backtest it.  Gwyn and Yana kept me very busy last week.  Yana, who lives  close by me was nice enough to drop off work at night.  Gywn and I worked on  the curves over the phone.   Yesterday, I got a call from Terry Thorn, he needed economic information and  a presentation to give to EGM management.  I gave him a copy of the  conforming assets presentation, he was very pleased.  This week, I'm working  on a urgent request from RAC.  The board has decided to resurrect Dragon 2,  so we are preparing all the curves for the APACHI region.  I'm also working  on the metals presentation.  See you Thursday.   Regards,   Maureen

The  problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!  Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the  direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we  also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with  this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend  independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and  settlement with regional hub?

Sue spoke on a panel today at the Valley Industry & Commerce Association (San Fernando Valley).  Marathon also attended and sent the following:         Subject:	Sue Mara & VICA  Hi Karen:  Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to business associations about energy.  The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session, people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.  David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than electricity.  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was completely unaware of current events at Enron.  David Freeman did not show up and he didn't send anyone in his place.  Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to reinstate direct access to please call.  Hope you have a good weekend.  Talk to you soon  Sandra

The settlement, being filed today is a compromise on all the issues and is  the result of negotiations.  Enron was the only marketer involved in the  process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items  that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final  agreement.  These items include the following:  1.  Native load language 2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as  of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four  years. 3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years. 4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately  separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years. 5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.   (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).  Below is a summary of the entire settlement:  1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001. 2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has  committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded  cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs  resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their  financial condition.   3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above. 4.  Generation is deregulated. 5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling,  reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of  transmission lines and eminent domain authority. 6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to  affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution  tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs. 7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no  later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05  if IOU's are in separate RTO's. 8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year  5 for remainder of transition period. 9.  Rate unbundling requirement 10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being  applied as an offset to distribution. Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually  increasing during the second six years for the residential and small  commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the  rate regulation ends 12/31/07. 11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the  transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must  contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as  an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default  customers. 12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years,  rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP  customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to  distribution. 13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or  APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per  kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years. 14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a  second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify  marketers but we defeated that). 15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.   16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other  plans. 17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the  minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300. 18. Utility worker protection plan.  Below for your information is the plan.     At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the  legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP  and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.  Janine

I would involve Michelle Cash or someone in Enron Corp who deals with  labor/employment issues. I am surprised this issue has not come up before.    Peter Keohane 02/27/2001 06:06 PM   cc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Litigation Counsel  Jim, we have a former employee who tried to exercise options which had  expired on the 31st day after employment termination, as the 30th day  provided for in the grant agreement was a Sunday.  Paine Webber refused and  she then asked us to honour the obligation in any event or to change her  employment termination date.  In consultation with Enron Corp. (Mary Joyce  and Michael Fauerbacher) the request was denied.  She has now sued both Enron  Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. in the Alberta courts.  The amount is not large  ($US27,000) but he principle and precedent value is.  I think our position is  very strong but there are some issues around the calculation of days from  termination and performance required on non-business days (which is not  provided for in the grant agreements).  I have a call with Mary Joyce and  Michael Fauerbacher of Enron Corp. tomorrow and was going to involve  litigation counsel - Dalton McGrath - a partner at Blake Cassels and Graydon  who is in my estimation very effective and aggressive.  Is this OK with you  and/or do we need to involve outside counsel in Houston to monitor Enron  Corp.'s interests?  Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks and regards, Peter.

Hi All -  The following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) project status:  TRV system training for Region Leads began last week.  Currently, Kam,  Phillip, Darron and Winfree have received training and Errol is scheduled for  tomorrow (5/15).  One request that came out of training was to provide a "left column freeze"  in order to scroll across and still maintain what row is being reviewed.  Hal  will follow up on this request.  Please forward me any additional requests  that may be required or suggestions you may have.   Please publish your region's report daily.  This will ensure report history  is being established and provide realistic information to review during UAT.   Also, we ask that each one of you review the system as much as possible  during the UAT review period this week to ensure the system is working  properly and is meeting your expectations.   Thank you for your help and support!  Shirley McDowell TRV Project / IT Project Manager

Macy's and Yahoo! Announce Finalists of 'Go to the Head of the Parade' National Campaign=1DAmerican Public to Begin Voting to Send One Lucky Kid to the 75th Anniversary Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade(TM) R ibbon-Cutting Ceremony   NEW YORK & SUNNYVALE, Calif., Oct 23, 2001 (BUSINE SS WIRE) -- Macy's, in association with Yahoo!(R) Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), today announces the three finalists of Macy's "Go To The Head of The Parade" nat ional campaign -- Kevin Connors, of Holmdel, N.J., Brent Paucke of Williams port, Pa. and Savannah Stewart of Warden, Ill. -- and invites the American  public to vote on http://macysparade.yahoo.com for the student they feel ha s best made a contribution to their community or school. From over 3,000 en tries received, these three finalists reflect the best of American youth. V oting will begin on Tuesday, October 23rd and run through Wednesday, Octobe r 31st.   The Go to The Head of The Parade national campaign was introduced in celebration of this year's historic 75th Anniversary Macy's Thanksgivin g Day Parade(TM) to recognize the contributions of America's youth. The cam paign, begun September 2, 2001, asked Americans across the country to submi t nominations of students, in essay form, via mail or online via Yahoo!, hi ghlighting their good deed for the community or school. This first-of-its-k ind program had teachers as well as civic, community and religious leaders  submit a 150-word essay nominating a student they felt had made a real diff erence in their school or community; something significant enough to allow  them to "Go To The Head Of The Parade." The campaign was open to middle or  high school students within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The finalists are:   Savannah Stewart, 12 years old, of Worden, Ill., nominate d by Deanna Regnier for her selflessness in making a difference for familie s in her community that are less fortunate. For the past five years, Savann ah has been supplying local pantries with food for Thanksgiving, as well as helping clothe neighborhood children with warm coats and shoes during the  winter. As if her caring and community service were not enough, Savannah th rows herself a birthday party and donates all the presents to needy childre n.   Kevin Connors, 17 years old, of Holmdel, N.J., nominated by March of D imes coordinator Joanne Procopio, for his fundraising efforts for the March of Dimes and for actively raising awareness on the importance of healthy l ifestyles. Kevin has raised over $40,000 for the March of Dimes to help sav e babies lives in 2001. At the age of five, Kevin experienced the death of  his cousin due to a heart defect, and since then, has shared his experience with others and has been committed to saving babies. Recognized as the Num ber One March of Dimes Youth Fundraiser, Kevin has raised over $88,000 in t he past five years.   Brent Paucke, 15 years old, of Williamsport, Pa., nom inated by Joseph Hurley, a friend of the family, because of the courage tha t Brent demonstrated in a time of crisis. One day at Bishop Neuman High Sch ool, Brent and his classmates had finished attending a service for the vict ims of the San Diego High School shooting. After the priest had said that n othing like that would ever happen in their school in Williamsport, Pa., it did. An eighth grade girl pulled a loaded pistol out of her backpack and s tarted yelling. Her gun went off and hit a girl in the shoulder. While ever yone was trying to find cover, Brent calmly talked the girl into dropping t he gun, then kicked it away, averting further catastrophe. For his heroic a ctions, Brent has garnered media attention, but most important of all, the  safety of his classmates and himself.   At the culmination of this campaign , one special child will have the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of participatin g in the traditional ribbon-cutting ceremony at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Par ade, officially starting the 75th annual trek down Broadway -- live on nati onal TV! In addition to the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the child and his or h er family will receive airfare and hotel accommodations for four, as well a s VIP viewing of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Broadcast live on NBC on N ovember 22nd, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will get the holiday season st arted in grand style!   Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade marks its 75th Anniv ersary this year, making it the longest running show on Broadway. Started i n 1924 as Macy's Christmas Parade, the Parade has grown in size and scope t hrough its remarkable 75-year history, becoming an American holiday traditi on, which has touched millions of lives around the world. With its high-fly ing fun, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which has been broadcast live for  half a century on NBC, has been in step with the times, showcasing popular  culture and closing the generation gap. From its humble beginnings with mor e than 400 employees to its legendary line-up of more than 8,000 strong, th e Parade has become a part of our lives as it has echoed the spirit of the  holiday season. The Parade is produced by Macy's East, which is a subsidiar y of Federated Department Stores, operating 117 stores in 15 states along t he East Coast.   About Yahoo! Inc.  Yahoo!

All,  Looking back through my postings for TW, there was only one posting in the two month period in question that pertained to available capacity or open season. It was posted on Dec. 1,  2000  3:19PM .  Attached is that posting.         Subject:	TW Index Deals  It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several "packages" and other details of the sale procedure.   That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers.   Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).  If it was a fax or other document or a script, we need to get our hands on it.  Kevin, Lorraine, TK, Susan--does anyone remember which it was or know how to get our hands on it?    If we are going to be in a dogfight with BP on these deals, lets make sure we go in armed with as much of the relevant information as possible to demonstrate we were following the rules.  DF

In addition, the most recent S&P write-up is attached below.   brant    Research:  Return to   Regular Format  Summary: El Paso Electric Co.  Publication Date:  01-Aug-2000  Analyst:  Judith Waite, New York (1) 212-438-7677   Credit Rating:  BBB-/Stable/--   Rationale    Debt reduction, cost cutting, and increased sales have brought El Paso   Electric Co. back toward  investment-grade benchmarks. The company has exceeded debt-reduction  targets and expects debt to be  about 50% of total capital by 2002. If sales continue to grow at even   one-half the historical 3% to 4% per year,  cash flow interest coverage should improve to 3.5 times by then. Still,   the ratings on El Paso Electric continue to  reflect the company=01,s high leverage, dependence on nuclear power, hi gh  fixed costs, and high rates.   The company borrowed heavily to fund its 15.8% interest in the Palo Ver de  nuclear plant, which supplies 50% of  the utility=01,s power. The plant=01,s past operating problems and cont inued  structural problems add some risk to the  company=01,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customer s in  the generally low-income service  territory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear   investment, helping to put El Paso Electric  in bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed   the company to keep a $25 million  rate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation o f  generation and transmission assets,  and froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electr ic  franchise.   In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New   Mexico and Texas, bringing them  more in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition   comes to either state (2002), El Paso  Electric will have a fairly competitive cost structure which should all ow  them to retain retail customers. By that  time, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated   transmission and distribution business  and an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New   Mexico and Texas law. Costs incurred  to effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition  charge. Stranded costs (accrued charges  related to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a   regulated market) will be recovered over  a five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate  settlement allowed El Paso to recover those costs  through accelerated depreciation over the 10-year period of the  settlement agreement.   In the wholesale market, El Paso successfully renegotiated contracts wi th  the Comision Federal de  Electricidad, the national utility of Mexico, to supply peaking capacit y  in the summer months of 2000 and 2001,  and with the Rio Grande Electric Cooperative Inc. to supply power to tw o  Texas cities over a four-year period.

We need to talk about instantaneous supply and how it is dealt with under your Sand Hills contract. The contract I am working on with Austin really doesn't address this issue and in order for me to include this in the contract we will need to talk. I have a call in also with Lonestar to talk about this as well. I have Janet Wallis helping me address some of these issues. We may want to schedule a meeting to include her also.  Let me know where we stand.
i told you so! ---------------------- Forwarded by Eric Bass/HOU/ECT on 07/05/2000 07:28 AM  ---------------------------   Celeste Roberts 06/30/2000 06:35 PM  cc:   Subject: Re: Program Changes    If you are currently an analyst in a commercial rotation, then you are  eligible for promotion to a third year analyst.  After you have completed  your third year, then you are eligible for promotion to a commercial  associate.  These guidelines were effective on 6/1/2000.  The conversation  that you and I had was prior to these changes.   Effective 6/1/2000, the  Office of the Chairman has made it very clear that we are to adhere to these  promotion guidelines going forward.  Celeste Roberts    Enron North America Corp.      cc:   Subject: Program Changes  Celeste,  I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the  program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you  informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid  year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only  reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was  tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible  for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.  I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this  PRC?  Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  Eric Bass x3-0977
Kathryn -  Below are the annex and amendment for Cargill and (per Brent) the updated Entergy-Koch agreements.  These can be released to the customers, subject to the caveat that I had in my earlier e-mail messages.  My strong suggestion is to have both of these companies, if they have comments, to have them mark or note their comments and forward them to me.  I will work with Brent to address their comments.  I hope to have Williams to you tomorrow.  Mark         Subject:	Entergy Koch    Thanks, Brent
FYI       Subject:	Kingman Heat Recovery    Hi Lorraine,  Next week I'm heading west to meet with Mohave Electric Co-op and EWS West Desk regarding this project.  I know we've spoken about it before, but I was hoping to have some time with you this afternoon to get you up to speed on our progress and get your input on the attached presentation.  Could I come by at 3:00pm?  Please advise.   Thanks, John
Here are some recent questions I've gotten from your classmates and my answers to them.   >  Thanks for the interesting articles. Could you > explain the following > statements from the Argentina article? Specifically > what is this > financing gap referred to below? How does it relate to > the fiscal deficit? > > Two basic scenarios have emerged. The more cautious is > that Argentina, held back by its strong currency and > lack of competitiveness in the region, will at best > see anaemic growth next year. That would be unlikely > to raise much enthusiasm among foreign investors, and > could complicate Argentina's task in raising the >  Dollars 17bn or more it needs from the capital > markets to cover next year's financing gap.  Basically, this is what the country needs to come up with to balance its Current account deficit.  Suppose everything is in balance but then a foreign exporter like Boeing sells a plane to Argentina but decides not to keep its pesos in Argentina in a bank account or by reinvesting it in the economy but instead to convert its proceeds into dollars.  Now unless an equivalent amount of pesos is invested by some other foreigners in Argentina (converting their dollars into Pesos), the currency board will have to sell dollars to Boeing in exchange for pesos and decrease the supply of pesos in the economy and reduce its foreign reserves.  Now think of millions of transactions going on.  If on balance, argentina has to use its foreign reserves to balance its current account it will start to deplete them.  At some point it would either have to devalue (to make it more expensive for Boeing to sell pesos for dollars) or effectively raise interest rates to very high levels in order to attract investment. Now, with a fixed exchange rate Argentina cannot devalue.  so it must raise interest rates which would further weaken the economy.  One solution is to lower its budget deficit.  This decreases the country's total borrowing needs and implies that interest rates will decline helping spur domestic investment.  This also helps to restore foreign investors' confidence.  This should lower the risk premium and bring down interest rates more.   >In terms of what shifts the IS-LM curve, are these things such as: > a. China's potential entry into WTO which would open up the market to  increased > foreign investment thus, increasing competition which would result in  increased > consumption (lower prices) and unltimately a shifting of the IS curve  because > there would be a greater demand for goods and services  This is really too indirect and long-term, you really want something that directly changes government spending or some sudden decision to change consumption or investment behavior in order to shift the IS curve.  It would be more like Japan's decision to stimulate the economy through more government spending.  Or say Brazil lowering pension payments thereby shifting the IS to the left.  Or how countries are suddenly forced to invest to counter Y2K  > In the book on p. 193, it says "expansionary fiscal policy abroad reduces  investment." > Not clear here.  This assumes that the foreign countries have a big effect on world savings (if not there is no effect).  In this case if they spend more they essentially reduce the amount of funds available to everyone else to borrow.  This drives up the world interest rate which lowers investment since the costs of investment is now higher (I is a function of r)  > P.194 on chart: why doesn't r* go up?  This is because in a small open economy, the interest rate is equal to the world interest rate which is fixed.  The country is too small to affect r.  The idea is exactly the same as in micro when we say that firms are price takers.  here the price is r.   > In Japan, how does 0% r get rid of deflation?   Think of it simply as increasing the money supply.  In the classical model (see p154-158).  A higher M results in higher prices.  This is the opposite of deflation where prices fall.

The deadline to accept this offer is April 27th.  A general outline of the phone call, should you choose to use it, would be:  1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas School  2) indentify yourself as "involved with the student government at the Haas School, and the evening office asked me to give you a call to see if you had any questions about the program.  Then answer the questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for further follow-up  3)describe your own experience at school and how it has worked with your career--timing, advancement, scheduling, tuition payments, etc.  4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them around.  EMBA office will coordinate.  5)remind them of the "New Students Admit Reception" on April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent email for other particulars.  Some pieces of information you might want to have handy  -required new student orientation is August 11-12; classes start on the 13th  -fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required, including the two units for MPAR  -orientation packages will be sent out mid-June  -administration will call each new student in July with class schedules  -second round of admits come out in early June  Thanks very much for helping.

Howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in Volume  Management's initials in OSS.  I need some information for Daren before it  can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for  11/97 forward.  I've done some research as follows:  1/95 shows delivery on transport contract #012-82269-02-002 (Southeastern  Marketing Co. as counterparty)  1/96 thru 10/31/97 shows delivery on transport contract #012-27182-02-001  (Esperanza Marketing Corp as counterparty).  11/97 thru 12/97 shows delivery on 089-41500-102  1/98 shows delivery on  089-41500-101  No other transactions at this meter since 1/98.  Some questions I need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport  contracts through 10/31/97 and then started to be allocated to the 089  contract later?  Are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to  and is that the reason the 089 contract was used?   Or should the transport  contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11/97 forward?  Each  item indicates a delivered volume, so either a transport  or sale is taking  place.    All the information that is supplied on the UA4 report is need a contract for  9,448 MMBTU.  Since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it  was assigned to me, it's difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used  for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in  CPR or OSS.  Need help, Stella       Daren J Farmer 12/22/99 07:14 AM  cc:   Subject: Re: UA4 - Meter 1441 for 11/97 - Falfurrias    What occurred at this point in prior months?  Who was allocated the volume?

Thanks for the note....remember that on NNG, Gray is an exempt point (fuel to the Permian Mids 1-7 is only 1.06 %, and the commodity is only about a penny more than from Halley).  This should have pretty good value for the summer (value similar to your West Texas lateral).  In the winter, the rate to demarc is 2.66% + 1.5 cent commodity on NNG if you want some pricing points.       Subject:	RE: Gray Interconnect  Jo, I actually mentioned this in our TW staff meeting with Steve yesterday about using the OBA's to balance this point for November service if the interconnect was not ready.

FYI, Michelle is working with Burlington to deliver gas to NNG@Gray on their firm contract as well as discussions with Oneok to deliver gas to TW@Gray.    Thanks, Kim.          Subject:	FW: Gray Interconnect  fyi.  I had requested Earl to provide an update on this interconnect.  If we have actual flows scheduled (and we know we have 25,000 of firm contracted) before the 12/1 date, we might have to do something at Halley to balance flows.  Should we start working out the details of that?       Subject:	RE: Gray Interconnect  Jo  R-O-W has gave 30 day notice to adjacent landowners Survey has been completed for pipeline SHPO & F&F survey being completed on pipeline route Valves has been quoted for a 8 -12 week delivery, unacceptable. Have requested buyer purchase Grove Valves with a 4 week delivery. Should know on pipe this week for delivery and cost. The existing Gray county I/C will be relocated to P-3 as a complete unit An 8" meter tube and two 12" valves have been located from surplus for installing at the original I/C with dry flow measurement Installation will be T&M to reduce time frame for bid package and drawings and allow quicker contractor move in and start up.  The target date is 11-1-01, but with the delay, 2 1/2 months, in approving the P.A., as stated in the original cost estimates, E&C required a June approval to meet the in service date of 11-1-01, we have a forecast ready for service date of 12-01-01. We will expedite materials and installation in an attempt to meet the target date. If any questions, lease let me know  Earl       Subject:	Gray Interconnect  Earl,  I haven't heard anything lately on the status of the Gray Interconnect.  Has the cost estimate remained the same?  What is the schedule for in-service?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Letting him stir is good in some ways but guys actually tend to like a lack  of clarity in relationships as it gives them more leeway.  However, I don't  really know the dynamic in your relationship at all.    So Angela and I made up from our huge saturday morning fight before I left on  Sunday and she cried like a baby when i left.  I feel so bad leaving her. She  is really broken hearted right now.

Hi Pete,  We will want to get the CofA contract fixed up shortly.  I don't remember if  we have addressed these issues.  I do think that GE may resist the combined  cycle language, and I don't suggest including it.  Eric, can you still live  with that?

Those changes  are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3  as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to  exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they  typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it  anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined  cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out,  then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and  their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust  guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.  Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to  your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I  therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a  separate word file.   Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit "U" is not in my  hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something from  GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.    If you have questions, give me a call.  (67550)  I will be in Ausitn  Wednesday and Thursday, but will be available by cell phone (713) 412-6873.  Thanks, Eric Booth
With everything going on, I wanted to speak with you about some issues, particularly how things may effect my group.  In light of the attached memo, it does not seem that we can do anything that will cost the company more than $50mm.  What does this mean for what we are looking at?  Can Enron even participate in the Arctic project as a $1mm commitment will, not including the potential additional liabilities, commit the company for more than $50mm.  I guess you can make an argument about it depends upon how you count it.  Anyway, please let me know when you have some time.  Cheers.

Daren, with Megan gone I just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the Enron payments owed to the Cleburne plant.  The current issues are as follows:  November Gas Sales					$600,377.50 October payment to ENA for TXU pipeline charges	$108,405.00 Cleburne receivable from Enron				$708,782.50  Less: November Gas Agency Fees			($54,000.00)  Net Cleburne Receivable from Enron			$654,782.50  Per my discussions with Megan, she stated that about $500K of the $600K Nov gas sales was intercompany (desk to desk) sales, with the remainder from TXU.  Are we able to settle any intercompany deals now? Are we able to settle with TXU?  Additionally, you'll see that I included the Oct TXU payment in the receivable owed to Cleburne also.  This is because I always pay Megan based upon the pipeline estimates in Michael's file, even though they are not finalized until the next month.  Therefore in my November payment to Enron, I paid ENA for October's estimate, of which Megan would have paid the final bill on 12/26/01 when it was finalized.  However, I had to pay the October bill directly last month, even though I had already sent the funds to ENA in November.  Therefore, I essentially paid this bill twice (once to ENA in Nov & once to TXU in Dec).  I deducted the November Agency Fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to Cleburne.  Please advise as to the status of these bills.  You can reach me at 713-853-7280.  Thanks.  James

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in  2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:  a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;  b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t he  (i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power  generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;  c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;  d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;  e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;  f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du e  to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and  g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.   These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth   and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that  success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a   number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The   goals of such re-alignment include:  a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe e  is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;  b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation   with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal   flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to   our trading organization;  c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate   our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase   our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;  d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a nd  origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better  align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;  e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent   with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and  f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar e  critical to meeting our goals next year.   With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode ls  in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are  being implemented:  a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark et  and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and   Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm an  (EA OOC).  This team will have one income statement, one book and a joint   accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the se  teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage   the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the  partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera te  origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,   provide information and generate strategic positions.  Overall, the team wi ll  be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting  coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the  Eastern power markets. The team will be responsible for covering the IOU=01 ,s,  muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials and IPP=01,s and will utilize all ENA=01,s pr oduct  capabilities including the power commodity, assets and capital. The team wi ll  further be broken down into several key strategic regions and business unit s  including:  (i) ERCOT =01) managed by Doug Gilbert Smith and Bruce Sukaly;  (ii) NE =01) managed by Dana Davis and Jeff Ader;  (iii) Midwest =01) managed by Fletch Sturm and Ed Baughman;  (iv) SE =01) managed by Rogers Herndon and Ozzie Pagan;  (v) East Power Development =01) managed by Ben Jacoby;  (vi) East Power Structuring  - managed by Bernie Aucoin; and  (vii) East Power Fundamentals and the =01&Genco=018 =01) managed by Lloyd Will    b) West Power =01) there will be no changes to the Portland office which is   managed by Tim Belden and Chris Calger .  Both Tim and Chris will continue  to  report to the EA OOC.  c) Canada and Mexico =01) there will be no changes to the Canadian or Mexic an  offices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively.    Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.  d) U.S. Natural Gas =01) there are several changes anticipated in this busi ness  consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes  primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region   will consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and  origination. Each team will have one income statement, one book and a joint   accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the se  teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage   the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the  partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera te  origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,   provide information and generate strategic positions. Overall, the team wil l  be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting  coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the  Eastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.  The team will be  responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU =01,s, IPP=01,s  and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side  of  the business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in   addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01, s  product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each  of  these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;  East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and   origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank   Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team.   West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag ed by  Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th e  Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under   this team.  Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed  co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be  integrated into this team.  Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team  will  continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa le  is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex as  gas business without ownership of the HPL assets.   Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n o  significant changes.  Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a nd  financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market  specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin ue to  maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and   industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,  mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas   marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.  Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several   distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi s  group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.   This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and   greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include   producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor  relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor  services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital  products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with   Texaco.   Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to  Frank  Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.  Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t o  Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.      Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi ed  projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas  transportation capacity trading opportunities.    There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power   groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams will  coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or  PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering   involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have   asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two  organizations in Houston.   e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou r  technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to  ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized  productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th e  Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks  and  will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA  organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In   addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will   report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio n  of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This  group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and   capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri sk  and monetize.   In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a nd  transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and   securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil l  report to the EA OOC.   f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new  opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by   Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed  generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from  Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the EA  OOC.   g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate  development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an d  will report to the EA OOC.   h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag ed by  Dave Duran.

Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday: Pipeline Power Partners 10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200 Houston, Texas 77024 713-290-8762 I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94. Note new email address also.  Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call.  Conrad  - winmail.dat
Dear Optionee:  According to our records, you exercised Enron stock options on either  December 27th or 28th.  When your stock options were initially exercised and  processed, the income was treated as year 2001 income.   We wanted to let you know that the income associated with your exercise will  be reported as income in the year 2000.  Therefore, your 2000 Form W-2 will  include these amounts as income.  Based on this, you will receive a revised confirmation of exercise from  PaineWebber.  If you reached the maximum limit for Social Security taxes for  the year 2000, then the Social Security taxes that were withheld on your  December 27th or 28th exercise will be refunded to you on your January 12,  2001 Enron paycheck.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Monique Blacklock at  (713) 345-7885.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.    All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.    Parking & Transportation Desk 3-7060

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my  recommendation to appoint Jeff Skilling as chief executive officer, effecti ve  at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will al so  retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continu e  as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the   strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.   Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all  cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for   the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I=01,m ready for  a  somewhat different role.   Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a nd  me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that  continues to exceed everyone=01,s expectations, including our own.  We look   forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.   There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad   shifts in strategy and direction.   Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.
Attached are the Canadian forms as they currently stand.  All of our forms  are currently under revision, so there may be some more changes coming out  soon.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change s  are intended to accomplish four key objectives:   First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu l  business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe.    This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position.   Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to   directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units   has become increasingly difficult.   Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin g  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin g  asset positions.   And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to   redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.   ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES   Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate   our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to   higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o f  Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an d  markets.   Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European   (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets  operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u nit  as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me rchant  businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this   new structure as described below.   Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum e  the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,  currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office   of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.   Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our   international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi p  positions:   Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President   and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit y  for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N orth  America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO   will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will  report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.   Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t he  Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our   broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region   will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office  of  the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for   Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi ness  into Enron Global Assets in the near future.    Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined   EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi ll  focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term  attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to   the EBS Office of the Chairman.   Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE S  to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or der  to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to  facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for   at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout h  America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to   the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the  transition, Jim will join EES.   In addition to these changes in our international asset operations  activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale   businesses and the commercial support functions:   Enron Net Works  Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President and  CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg.    Enron Americas  Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for   operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,  marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor t  into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility   for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South  America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief  Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron  Americas.   Enron Europe  The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust ralia  and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John   Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.   Enron Global Markets  Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and   CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have  responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the  exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and  associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to   Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the   commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,  equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.   Enron Industrial Markets  Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM ahon,  President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.   Commercial Support for EWS  The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b y,  the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in   the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more   efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.   To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across   EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These   newly defined roles are as follows:   Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic e  Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,   with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice  President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat ed  services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the  wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these   services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will   continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible   for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.  Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.  Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized  on a  regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in   the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all   European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin ue  to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions   and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi ef  of Staff.  Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region al  basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,  Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue   in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble r  will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as   well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.   These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship   to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.  Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co ver  EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.   Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale  Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization   continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.   ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION  AND ENRON WIND   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen ts  around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to   EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif f  Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E nron  Wind, will report to Cliff.   CORPORATE STAFF   We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,  Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In   that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and   Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an d  Chief of Staff.   COMMITTEE STRUCTURE   In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s   growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our  business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to   be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a nd  the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be  drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the  performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses.    The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.   We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit tee.   This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel  management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy  Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.   We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital  to  our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and  supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

Governor  BYLINE: ALEXA HAUSSLER   DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.  BODY:  ???Gov. Gray Davis is getting his first glimpse of relief after months defending the state's soaring electricity prices and rolling blackouts.  ??A series of events from plummeting wholesale energy and natural gas prices  to the unexpected shift in the U.S. Senate has Davis declaring that the state has ''turned a corner'' in its power woes.  ??But the governor, whose popularity ratings have taken a dive in recent months, must still weather steaming summer months and homeowner reactions to record-high electricity bills.  ??''Some irreparable damage has been done to his image and his popularity,'' said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley.  ??Two recent statewide polls showed that as electricity rates climbed, Davis' approval rating plummeted to its lowest marks since he took office in 1998.  ??Davis, who is up for re-election next year, is battling his image as a middle-of-the-road leader and has adopted a confrontational style to deal with the power crisis.  ??In May, he hired high-powered crisis control specialists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, trained at the Clinton White House and in the Al Gore  presidential campaign. He declared ''war'' on Texas-based energy wholesalers.  ??Davis also attacked the Bush administration for opposing price controls on wholesale electricity.  ??Soon after, the crisis-weary governor's fortunes shifted.  ??Vermont Sen. James Jeffords announced he would defect from the GOP, handing the majority and committee chairmanships to Democrats who favor price caps on wholesale electricity.   ??President Bush, criticized for failing to visit California since taking office, traveled to the state and met with Davis.  ??When the state Energy Commission announced that Californians had cut power use by 11 percent in May over the previous year, Davis declared a personal victory. He had called for residents and businesses to conserve 10 percent.  ??Last week, wholesale electricity prices plunged from more than $500 a megawatt hour to about $50 a megawatt hour their lowest level in a year while natural gas prices also dropped.  ??Some experts attributed the price spiral to conservation efforts and mild Western temperatures, which have reduced the need to run air conditioners.  ??But the governor's aides argue the declining prices are a direct result of Davis signing long-term contracts with energy providers.  ??''We may still have some difficult days ahead of us in the summer but it's pretty clear that the governor's strategy has now borne some fruit,'' said  Garry South, chief campaign adviser to Davis.  ??Still, the energy crisis has battered Davis, once considered a potential presidential contender in 2004.  ??California, heavily reliant on the technology sector, is facing its toughest budget crunch in years.  ??Critics argue Davis has called a premature victory in the energy crisis. The state has yet to sell $13.4 billion worth of bonds to repay the state for  power buys, and California relies heavily on the spot power market to make up for electricity shortages.  ??California Republicans, meanwhile, are fortifying their own campaign strategy. The state party hired veteran consultant Rob Stutzman to counter Davis' hiring of Lehane and Fabiani.  ??And Stutzman says Davis has little for which to take credit.  ??''The governor is like a little kid that breaks his mother's china and then wants credit for gluing half of it back together,'' Stutzman said.  ??Davis' short-term fortunes look promising, however. The state Democrats control both houses of the Legislature and all but one statewide office.  ??Davis also holds strong leads over the two Republicans who have announced they will challenge him, Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles businessman William E. Simon Jr.  ??Whoever runs against Davis will find an incumbent with more than $26 million raised for next year's election and a team of campaign advisers already using focus groups and polling to gauge public reaction to the power crisis.  LOAD-DATE: June 12, 2001  ??????????????????????????????4 of 48 DOCUMENTS  ??????????????????????Copyright 2001 Copley News Service  ?????????????????????????????Copley News Service  ????????????????????????????June 12, 2001, Tuesday  SECTION: State and regional  LENGTH: 910 words  HEADLINE: Public furious at 19 percent rate hike;PUC says its hands are tied  BYLINE: Craig D. Rose  DATELINE: SAN DIEGO  BODY:  ??California tends to unanimity when it comes to electricity deregulation: The legislature passed it unanimously in 1996, and people who testified at rate  hike hearings yesterday voiced unanimous opposition.  ??Speakers at public hearings in San Diego and El Cajon alternately demanded and implored the California Public Utilities Commission to reject an average  19 percent rate hike that the commission says it is obligated by state law to  pass along to SDG&E electricity customers.  ??Perhaps the loudest applause from an audience that approached 100 at the downtown San Diego hearing yesterday afternoon came in response to calls for  the state to exercise its power of eminent domain and seize power plants.  ??Guy Mock, a Navy enlisted man who was among those calling for such  takeovers, said many in military service are finding rising utility costs a significant burden, pushing some to use food stamps.  ??''Remember, people in the military have no choice about being here,'' Mock said.  ??Waving computer printouts from research he said he conducted on the  Internet, Mock said generators were charging outrageous prices, noting in particular the recent revelation that at one point Duke Energy had charged nearly $3,900 a megawatt-hour for its electricity. Last spring, a megawatt-hour sold for less than $30.  ??''Let's take it over,'' Mock suggested as a solution to the power crisis.  ??An overflow crowd of about 250 people attended a hearing at the El Cajon Community Center that at times took on the flavor of a church revival.  Audience members cheered, clapped and called out comments in support of almost 50  people who spoke at the hearing.  ??''There are a couple of hundred here who are very irritated,'' said Chris Medicus of El Cajon. He said he has been conserving energy even before calls  to cut back on power use.  ??''Who's going to do something for me since I can conserve no more?''  ??Edy Mason, a retired nurse who lives in El Cajon, said she can't afford her rising rent and utility bills on the $732 she receives each month.  ??''This is legal rape. I'm tired of being raped. This has to stop,'' Mason said.  ??Dan McKenna, chief of the Rural Fire Protection District that serves unincorporated areas of the county, said fire and emergency medical services will be hurt if there is a rate increase. Fire departments are already having  to spend large portions of their budgets on energy costs, he said.  ??''That's unacceptable, sir,'' he said as members of the audience clapped and called out, ''That's right.''  ??Despite the appeals for tough action, Carl Wood, the only member of the California Public Utilities Commission in attendance at yesterday's hearings, insisted that the commission was obligated to pass along the proposed 19  percent rate hike demanded by the California Department of Water Resources.  ??Under legislation passed earlier this year, the department began purchasing power for state utility customers. The same legislation gave the department  the right to self-judge the reasonableness of its rate hike requests, a function formerly allocated to the utilities commission.  ??That leaves the PUC with a limited role in the rate hike process, Wood acknowledged.  ??''We are here to spread the pain,'' said the commissioner, who noted that customers who use 130 percent or less of the baseline amount are shielded from any rate hike by state law. The baseline allowance, which is printed on  utility bills, is a subsistence amount of electricity that varies by location and climate.  ??But Wood also said later, ''We have to (raise rates) if we want to keep  power flowing.''  ??San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob was not persuaded. Jacob said the duty of the commission is to ensure just and reasonable utility rates for Californians.  ??''The only way for the commission to fulfill its mission is to disobey the (water department),'' Jacob said. ''I urge the commission to refuse the $915 million rate increase request from the DWR.''  ??Nearly all other speakers agreed, with many blasting the notion that consumers should be forced to pay for the fallout of a deregulation plan they said was designed by major energy corporations for their own benefit.  ??''They spent the money, they had the party and now they are asking the  little guys to clean up the mess,'' said Frank Jordan.  ??Another speaker said the utilities commission would find options to the rate hike if it tapped into public outrage over the electricity crisis.  ??''Don't throw more money at the problem,'' said Robert Womack of La Mesa. ''Give us the chance to throw our weight around and we have plenty of weight  to throw around.''  ??Holly Duncan of San Diego was as upset over the rate hike process as she was over the increase itself. Duncan noted that the water department which in  effect ordered the rate hike was declining to release its power purchase contracts. That left her, she said, in the position of paying for something that was negotiated in secret.  ??''Where is our systems of checks and balances?'' Duncan asked.  ??The commission is expected to have a proposed rate hike plan ready by June 21, with a final vote on the increase slated for June 28.  ??Additional public hearings will be held at 1 p.m. today at the Country Inn Hotel, 35 Via Pico Plaza, San Clemente, and at 7 p.m. today at the California Center for the Arts, Escondido, 340 N.

The companies were told to justify those prices or refund them.  ??"Williams has filed justification for its prices with the FERC and  calculated its refund liability under the methodology used by the FERC to compute refund amounts at approximately $11 million," Williams said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Williams said it continues to object to refunds in any amount.

BYLINE: JERRY HIRSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER  BODY:  ??Edison International plans to raise $1.2 billion in a complex transaction that would tap the borrowing capacity of its only significant profit center--a move critical to the firm's financial health.  ??The financing would pay off $618 million in Edison bank debt that comes due June 30. Additionally, the offering would be used to pay off $600 million of floating rate notes due by year's end.  ??Mission Energy Holding Co., a company created by Edison International for  the sole purpose of issuing these bonds, will offer the notes. The assets of  Edison Mission Energy, a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the United States and in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, will secure the debt.  ??Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Rosemead-based Edison International in the form of dividends, giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt.  ??Despite the backing of such heavy hitters as Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs Group, some analysts question whether there is enough investment interest to make the deal work.  ??"I am not sure what type of appetite the market will have for this," said  Jon Cartwright, a bond analyst with Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.  ??The financing plan comes as the firm is struggling to keep its ailing Southern California Edison electric utility out of Bankruptcy Court. Edison International can pursue the deal because of its byzantine corporate  structure, designed to reduce the risk that Edison Mission Energy would be dragged into  any potential bankruptcy of either the parent company or corporate sibling SCE.  ??The question, Cartwright said, is whether that separation, erected under a financial legal doctrine called "ring fencing," provides enough protection to make lending money palatable to investors.  ??"What price are you willing to get for a security that looks like it will have to be tested in Bankruptcy Court?" Cartwright asked.  ??Edison International, which declined to comment about the offering, plans to start pitching it on Wall Street this week.  ??Even if the offering were completed, Edison International probably would pay a high price for its borrowing.  ??Cartwright said a similarly rated bond at another company would pay an interest rate of about 9.67%, but given the risk he would expect investors to demand a higher yield.  ??The notes will have a credit rating of BB-minus and come due in 2008, said Standard & Poor's, the bond rating agency. That's slightly higher than the near-default CC rating now carried by Edison International.  ??Standard & Poor's said the transaction could raise Edison International's credit rating to a CCC-plus grade--better but still considered a junk rating  by the investment community.  ??In issuing its rating for the offering Monday, Standard & Poor's said that "the prospects of a bankruptcy filing by or against SCE remain high."  ??That reflects the rating agency's assessment that it is increasingly  unlikely that the state will complete a rescue plan devised by Edison and Gov. Gray Davis, which calls for the state to purchase SCE's transmission lines for  nearly $2.8 billion and issue up to $3.5 billion in ratepayer-secured bonds to pay  off debts from purchasing electricity at higher rates than it was allowed to  charge customers.  ??Edison International shares closed unchanged Monday at $11 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 30% this year.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER  DATELINE: SACRAMENTO  BODY:  ??Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summer as long  as the electricity they produce is sold in the state.  ??State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts.  ??Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Resources Board.  ??Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,200 megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are  permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so  heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes.  ??Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order.  ??In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened.  ??"If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired  plants]," said Witherspoon of the air board, "we will see people turning to diesel more frequently."  ??Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: "If you don't run these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run something dirtier."  ??Fluckiger said the order expands "the number of hours these things can run and the amount of energy they can produce."  ??New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatt-hour of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by the order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatt-hour.  ??If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours this summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of  oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air.  ??The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the extra pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 per  pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 200,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money would be  used to reduce air pollution from other sources.  ??"Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund," said Gail Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.  "Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emission reductions any time soon."  ??A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one  peaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent of  adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Reliant Energy could  not be reached for comment Monday night.  ??"To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's going to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to make our  air dirtier," said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for Ventura County.  ??Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was needed so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power this  summer.  ??"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our excess capacity to the state," Wiggs said.  ??He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price  for the power. Wiggs said the city is "negotiating to get our cost as low as we  can legally charge" so that customers of the city utility district are not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility districts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the order.  ??Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell power to the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Reliant  Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have called on Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fired facilities.  ??"This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in Ventura County residents' lungs," said Baldwin of Ventura County.  ??Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, also said it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much of what  they had sought.  ??"We have serious concerns about the order," said Feuer of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It's taking the discretion away from local air districts to regulate power plants in their region."  ??*  ??Times staff writer Nancy Vogel contributed to this story.  ??RELATED STORY  ??Utility: Edison plans to raise $1 billion in debt restructuring.

SEELYE  DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11  BODY:  ??The Bush administration has decided to force California to use ethanol as an antipollution fuel additive, a move that the critics say could result in an increase of at least 5 cents a gallon at the pump this summer in that state.  ??California had asked the federal government to be exempted from a Clean Air Act requirement to use fuel additives like ethanol to cleanse its gasoline, arguing that cheaper technologies were available.  ???Administration officials said today that the government would issue a decision on Tuesday denying the request.  ??Last Friday, in a speech in Iowa, Mr. Bush hinted at the decision, saying he supported the use of ethanol "not only to reduce dependency on foreign sources of energy but secondly as a way to clean the air."  ??Several Democratic senators from farm states, including Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the new majority leader, and Tom Harkin of Iowa, the new chairman of  the Agriculture Committee, saw a favorable decision as a huge boon to their  states' economies and had urged Mr. Bush to deny California the waiver.  ??It was Mr. Daschle -- and former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas -- who began the push for ethanol a decade ago by inserting in the Clean Air Act an amendment that required 2 percent of cleaner-burning gasoline to contain oxygenates like ethanol.  ??The act required that it be sold in cities with the worst smog: Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Hartford, Houston, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Sacramento and San Diego.  ??Some California fuel has oxygenates throughout the year, but in most Northeastern states the additives are used only in the winter months to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide.  ??The decision opens up the biggest market in the country to corn producers and, in particular, could benefit the Archer Daniels Midland agribusiness, a major Republican contributor, because it is one of the few ethanol producers able to transport ethanol to the West and East Coasts.  ??But environmentalists say there are now less expensive, less complex ways to reduce such pollution than adding ethanol.  ??And they contend that Mr. Bush's decision is intended to solidify his  support in the farm states that he won in the last election and help him make an important overture to Iowa, which he lost.  ??Several Northeast states were waiting to see whether California received its waiver before applying for their own, but a spokesman for a consortium of  those states said today that they would not apply and without it would expect to see an increase in gasoline prices.  ??Gov. Gray Davis of California, who has already clashed with the White House over its energy policy and its refusal to place price caps on electricity,  said the decision could cost Californians, who already pay the highest gas prices  in the nation, an additional 6 cents per gallon, or about $450 million a year for the estimated 580 million gallons of ethanol that will be needed annually.  ??Janet Hathaway, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, with a specialty in fuels and vehicles, said the decision "means that the whole  country has to use ethanol in every gallon of reformulated gas, which means suddenly a lot of demand has to chase a limited supply, which always means prices go up."  ??Ms. Hathaway added, "It's not necessary to use ethanol to achieve the same environmental results."  ??There are basically two widely available additives, or oxygenates, that help cleanse gasoline -- ethanol and M.T.B.E. (methyl tertiary butyl ether). But M.T.B.E. has been found to contaminate drinking water and is being phased out  in 11 states, including California and much of the Northeast.  ??The administration's expected decision would force those states instead to use ethanol, an alcohol made by the fermentation of sugars from corn, which  last year constituted two-thirds of 1 percent of the gasoline produced in this country.  ??California argued two years ago to the Environmental Protection Agency that it wanted a waiver from such a mandate because refiners had other ways to  blend gasoline that were cheaper and cleaner.  ??The agency under the Clinton administration decided to grant the waiver, concluding that it would reduce emissions, but President Bill Clinton never completed action on the matter.  ??David Uchic, a spokesman for the National Corn Growers Association, said he doubted California's claim of cheaper, cleaner blends.  ??"If you want to tell us you can refine a gas that meets the Clean Air standards and is cheaper than ethanol-added enhanced gas, go ahead," Mr. Uchic said. "Let's see the numbers."  ??In addition, he said the Bush decision was a flat-out victory for his industry, which hopes to triple ethanol production over the next decade.  ??"This will spur new investment in ethanol plants and in expanding existing facilities, and we just see production going up, up, up," Mr. Uchic said.  ??Jason Grumet, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a consortium of state agencies, said the administration's decision was ill-conceived and potentially harmful. ?"We will be paying more money for higher-polluting gasoline," Mr. Grumet said. "This  is a decision that will profoundly benefit a couple of multinational agribusinesses at the expense of the environment, drivers and the small farmer."  ??http://www.nytimes.com  LOAD-DATE: June 12, 2001  ??????????????????????????????10 of 48 DOCUMENTS  ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co.  ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle  ????????????????????JUNE 12, 2001, TUESDAY, FINAL EDITION  SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1  LENGTH: 760 words  HEADLINE: Air standards lowered for power plants;  DAVIS ORDER: They can run overtime  SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau  BYLINE: Robert Salladay, Lynda Gledhill  BODY: Gov. Gray Davis eased California's air pollution standards for power plants yesterday with an executive order that will allow some to run overtime this summer and squeeze out extra electricity.  ???Energy advisers said the governor's order actually would cause less pollution in the coming months because it allows natural-gas powered plants to run longer and reduce the need to run dirtier diesel-powered generators often used as backups.  ???"If you don't run these, you're either going to have outages, or you're going to run something dirtier," said Davis adviser Kellan Fluckiger.  ???Under the current state of emergency, the governor has sweeping powers to make changes in the law.  ???The Davis administration roughly estimated that about 1,200 megawatts in extra power could be produced and sold to California, enough to supply an estimated 1.2 million homes. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which has been selling its extra electricity to the state, said it might be  able to supply 1,000 megawatts alone.  ???Under the current law, power plants in California are allowed to emit specific amounts of major pollutants -- nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide -- and then must shut down when they reach a federal and state quota.  ???The executive order allows power plants in California to bypass those environmental standards as long as they sell the extra power to the state or another California-based utility. The order lasts until Davis rescinds it.  ???EXEMPTION TRADE-OFFS  ???In exchange for the exemptions, the power generators must pay penalties for the extra pollution they cause. The fines would probably range around $37.50  for every megawatt produced during these peak periods, according to Catherine Witherspoon with the California Air Resources Board.  ???Although prices are falling, a megawatt hour has sold on the daily market for more than $500 -- at one point soaring to as much as $1,900.  ???Money from the fines would be put into local pollution-control accounts and used to reduce emissions elsewhere, Witherspoon said. She said the governor's order was the best way to get more power and still maintain environmental standards.  ???Witherspoon said the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which needs  to approve the new standards set by Davis, had been "very cooperative."  ???"Bringing the maximum amount of power out of natural gas capacity is really going to help," Witherspoon said. "If we don't get every last megawatt we can, we will see people turning to diesel more frequently."  ???The South Coast Air Quality District, which is the largest and most  polluted area of the state, already has been allowing power plants to produce more  power in exchange for higher fines, said Ralph Cavanagh of Natural Resources Defense Council.  ???"The key is whether the mitigation fund being set up will actually be used to offset pollution," he said. The "jury is still out" on how successful the program has been, Cavanagh said.  ???Cavanagh agreed that using natural gas plants was much better than diesel, something the Davis administration is considering. "Clearly we want to  suppress the operation of diesel," he said. "To the extent that it reduces diesel, that is a benefit."  ???The state's municipal utilities have for months been asking Davis for yesterday's exemption so they can run their natural-gas-powered plants longer, and presumably make some money off the increase in sales. Power prices are at their highest in history.  ???Davis has previously threatened the public utilities takeover because of  the high prices being charged the state, which has spent about $8.3 billion to purchase power since January. The utilities have said they are only passing along the high cost of the natural gas used to produce the electricity.  ???"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our excess capacity to the state," said David Wiggs, general manager of the L.A. Department of Water and Power.  ???The price of the extra power is "being negotiated now with the governor's people at the direction of Mayor (Richard) Riordan to get the cost as low as possible," Wiggs said.

A1  LENGTH: 898 words  HEADLINE: U.S. panel steps up probe of supplier;  NATURAL GAS: Charges of price fixing  SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers  BYLINE: Bernadette Tansey, Zachary Coile  BODY: Federal regulators widened their investigation yesterday of a Texas natural  gas firm accused of inflating statewide energy prices, reversing an earlier order that had partially exonerated the company.  ???The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 4-to-0 ruling in the investigation of El Paso Corp., backed by Pat Wood, the Bush administration's new appointee, was greeted by California's chief energy regulator as a turning point in the commission's attitude toward state complaints of price gouging.  ???The commission's action "signals a whole new chapter of vigilant enforcement," said Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities Commission.  ???The federal commission reopened the question of whether El Paso rigged the bid for a huge block of capacity on its gas pipeline in favor of its own marketing affiliate, thus stifling competition that could have prevented  natural gas prices from soaring to the levels they reached last winter.  ???In the past year, gas from the Southwest has sold at the California border at prices as much as 10 times the nationwide average, driving up the price of consumers' heating bills and of electricity produced at power plants that run  on natural gas.  ???In March, before Wood was appointed, the commission cleared El Paso of complaints by California officials that the firm had engineered the takeover  by its marketing arm of more than one-third of the space on its pipeline into California. That pipeline supplies half of the state's gas.  ???In the same ruling, however, the commission ordered a trial-like hearing on the separate question of whether El Paso exercised near-monopoly market power  to boost its profits.  ???The PUC, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison say El Paso's pipeline affiliate and its marketing subsidiary combined to prevent competing shippers from importing natural gas, jacking up prices.  ???The hearing, which has already stretched from an original schedule of four days to more than five weeks, will now be expanded for evidence on accusations that l Paso broke federal regulations against preferential treatment for affiliates.  ???COMPANY NOT WORRIED  ???El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said the probe would reinforce the commission's original decision that El Paso was innocent of rigging the  pipeline bid.  ???"We're confident they'll use the same information to reach the same conclusion," Dunn said.  ???Harvey Morris, the PUC's lead attorney in the case, said the order could lead to harsher penalties against El Paso if an administrative law judge found wrongdoing.  ???Lynch said last week that El Paso should be forced to pay back California for what the state considers its excess costs during the 15-month contract between the company and its marketing arm, El Paso Merchant Energy. The state has never estimated that figure, but consultants for Edison say the alleged market manipulation cost California an extra $3.7 billion.  ???The PUC first asked the federal commission to void the contract in April 2000. By the time the commission ordered a hearing, the contract was close to its expiration date -- this past May 31.  ???Wood, who was sworn in to the commission last week, said in a concurring opinion yesterday that such cases should be investigated promptly.  ???"In the framework of active energy markets, it is critical that the commission act expeditiously on complaints," Wood wrote.  ???RAISING THE BAR  ???Wood's remark "seems to raise the bar for FERC" in its role as a market watchdog, Lynch said.  ???There has been much speculation about how Wood's presence will affect the federal commission, which has been at odds with California officials over virtually every area of energy policy.  ???Wood, a 38-year-old lawyer, was nominated to the Texas Public Utilities Commission by then-Gov. George W. Bush in 1995. At the time, Bush said that  Wood "shares my conservative philosophy" and would bring a free-market approach to regulation.  ???Bush administration officials have hinted that Wood will replace Curt  Hebert as chairman of the federal commission, though White House spokesman Ari Fleischer dampened the speculation last week, saying Hebert was not in danger  of losing his job.  ???On his recent trip to the state, Bush said he had assigned Wood to investigate the high cost of natural gas delivered to California.  ???Wood has spoken to Gov. Gray Davis twice on the phone about the energy crisis. The two plan to meet in Washington on June 20, said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis.  ???"The governor was enthusiastic about Pat Wood after his conversations with him," Maviglio said. "He feels the commissioner understands the issues out  here, and he promises to provide some relief in one form or another."  ???Davis declined to comment on yesterday's decision until he had time to read it.  ???The PUC's Morris said that it was no coincidence that gas prices in California had dropped dramatically since El Paso Merchant Energy's contract expired May 31, and 30 competing shippers started to share the pipeline capacity.  ???"It's no longer the 800-pound gorilla on the El Paso system," Morris said.  ???El Paso spokeswoman Dunn said prices had dropped because of a wide range of factors, including mild weather, increased hydroelectric power production and  a lower demand for gas.E-mail Bernadette Tansey at btansey@sfchronicle.com. and Zachary Coile at zcoile@sfchronicle.com.

Davis says, "The federal government must do its part to  temporarily control runaway energy prices." Again, nonsense. The "runaway energy prices" California pays are a direct result of a conscious decision to export  pollution to its neighboring states for 12 years.  ???And, it should be pointed out, demanding that the federal government institute "temporary" price controls is the equivalent of demanding that the rest of the states pay for accepting California's pollution.  ???Until California brings its own generators on line -- and the refining-pipeline capacity to fuel them -- let it whine in the dark.

LENGTH: 439 words  HEADLINE: 'Blackout' sheds some light on spike in energy costs  BYLINE: By Steve Johnson, Tribune media critic.  BODY:  ??You are reading this, I presume, with the lights on. Don't get too comfortable with that idea.  ??The very timely "Frontline" episode titled "Blackout" (9 p.m., WTTW-Ch. 11) examines the new circumstances that led to California's energy crisis, in particular, but also the natural-gas price spike that made last winter so long and costly in Illinois.  ??The episode, reported with The New York Times, suggests very strongly that what happened in the Golden State was not simply another case of isolated left-coast kookiness, like est, but rather a case of left-coast kookiness  likely to spread to the rest of the country, like salad bars.  ??It is, in other words, a cautionary tale, and then some. The take from correspondent Lowell Bergman -- yes, the fellow from "The Insider" who used to be a top "60 Minutes" producer -- blames free-market theory mixed with the  basic business principle of trying to make as much money as you can. Electricity deregulation and other legal developments paved the way for a new class of businesspeople, ones who trade power like any other commodity. Regulatory agencies, meanwhile, have either had their teeth taken away or have lost the will to use them.  ??The effect was especially profound in California because a deregulation bill that satisfied neither free marketers nor public-interest groups had forced power companies to get rid of their generating plants. They were at the mercy  of the markets, the markets found a way to charge more, and that -- again, in Bergman's take -- is why the cost of electricity jumped by more than a  multiple of 10.  ??At the heart of this debate is the question of whether the nation can afford to treat power like soybeans. The California evidence suggests not, but Bergman's interviews, including one with Vice President Richard Cheney,  suggest this administration will continue to follow the free-market path that, coincidentally, helps some of its biggest campaign donors.  ??Two side notes:  ??- It is fascinating to see Bergman, who used to be a resolutely behind-the- scenes guy, take so readily to appearing on camera. He makes sure to include some of his best moments as a questioner, even when they're not necessarily  key to the story. Mike Wallace, his old partner, would be proud, but it's a different style than "Frontline" viewers are used to, where the correspondent stays out of the way.  ??- This "Frontline" received heavy advance publicity before it aired last Tuesday on most PBS stations nationwide. WTTW says the episode was a late addition to the "Frontline" schedule and the station was already locked into pledge programming at that time.

Gray Davis as power prices dip  BYLINE: By ALEXA HAUSSLER, Associated Press Writer  DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.  BODY:  ??Gov. Gray Davis is getting his first glimpse of relief after months  defending the state's soaring electricity prices and rolling blackouts.  ??A series of events - from plummeting wholesale energy and natural gas prices to the unexpected shift in the U.S. Senate - has Davis declaring that the  state has "turned a corner" in its power woes.  ??But the governor, whose popularity ratings have taken a dive in recent months, must still weather steaming summer months and homeowner reactions to record-high electricity bills.  ??"Some irreparable damage has been done to his image and his popularity,"  said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the  University of California at Berkeley.  ??Two recent statewide polls showed that as electricity rates climbed, Davis' approval rating plummeted to its lowest marks since he took office in 1998.  ??Davis, who is up for re-election next year, is battling his image as a middle-of-the-road leader and has adopted a confrontational style to deal with the power crisis.  ??In May, he hired high-powered crisis control specialists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, trained at the Clinton White House and in the Al Gore  presidential campaign. He declared "war" on Texas-based energy wholesalers.  ??Davis also attacked the Bush administration for opposing price controls on wholesale electricity.  ??Soon after, the crisis-weary governor's fortunes shifted.  ??Vermont Sen. James Jeffords announced he would defect from the GOP, handing the majority and committee chairmanships to Democrats who favor price caps on wholesale electricity.   ??President Bush, criticized for failing to visit California since taking office, traveled to the state and met with Davis.  ??When the state Energy Commission announced that Californians had cut power use by 11 percent in May over the previous year, Davis declared a personal victory. He had called for residents and businesses to conserve 10 percent.  ??Last week, wholesale electricity prices plunged from more than $500 a megawatt hour to about $50 a megawatt hour - their lowest level in a year - while natural gas prices also dropped.  ??Some experts attributed the price spiral to conservation efforts and mild Western temperatures, which have reduced the need to run air conditioners.  ??But the governor's aides argue the declining prices are a direct result of Davis signing long-term contracts with energy providers.  ??"We may still have some difficult days ahead of us in the summer but it's pretty clear that the governor's strategy has now borne some fruit," said  Garry South, chief campaign adviser to Davis.  ??Still, the energy crisis has battered Davis, once considered a potential presidential contender in 2004.  ??California, heavily reliant on the technology sector, is facing its toughest budget crunch in years.  ??Critics argue Davis has called a premature victory in the energy crisis. The state has yet to sell $13.4 billion worth of bonds to repay the state for  power buys, and California relies heavily on the spot power market to make up for electricity shortages.  ??California Republicans, meanwhile, are fortifying their own campaign strategy. The state party hired veteran consultant Rob Stutzman to counter Davis' hiring of Lehane and Fabiani.  ??And Stutzman says Davis has little for which to take credit.  ??"The governor is like a little kid that breaks his mother's china and then wants credit for gluing half of it back together," Stutzman said.  ??Davis' short-term fortunes look promising, however. The state Democrats control both houses of the Legislature and all but one statewide office.  ??Davis also holds strong leads over the two Republicans who have announced they will challenge him, Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles businessman William E. Simon Jr.  ??Whoever runs against Davis will find an incumbent with more than $26 million raised for next year's election and a team of campaign advisers already using focus groups and polling to gauge public reaction to the power crisis.

On top of her folding table sits family photos and a gift bag that reads, "A donation would be  greatly appreciated."  ??Hoover said electricity is essential to her well-being. She needs power to keep her medicine cool and to work her electric hospital bed. And because her disability check isn't enough to pay all the expenses, Hoover said she has no choice but to ask strangers for help pay her $300 San Diego Gas & Electric  bill.  ??"We don't have money for anything but food," she said Monday. "My children are so ashamed we have to do this."  ??San Diegans were the first in the state to pay out of control power prices and they will soon experience another first - an electric rate hike imposed by the state.  ??The California Department of Water Resources, which recently took over electricity buying for the state's cash-strapped utilities, is raising San  Diego Gas & Electric rates 19 percent to collect $915 million the agency says it  needs to make those purchases. The rate hike was the subject of a public hearing Monday, where residents like Hoover had the opportunity to tell state  regulators how they felt about such increases.  ??Customers of SDG&E were the first to be exposed to unrestricted power prices under the state's 1996 deregulation law, which is widely blamed for the  current energy crisis. After local residents saw their power bills double and triple last summer, the California Legislature stepped in last fall and froze bundled rates at about 15 cents a kilowatt hour.  ??The DWR will raise rates on average by 2.77 cents per kilowatt-hour to 17.87 cents a kilowatt-hour, according to the Public Utilities Commission. A kilowatt-hour is enough to light 10 100-watt lamps for one hour.  ??SDG&E, which serves 1.2 million customers in San Diego and Orange counties, has a separate request to raise rates an additional 16 percent or 2.3 cents  per kilowatt-hour, pending before the PUC. The utility says the increase would  raise $800 million to cover losses it incurred paying skyrocketing prices of electricity before the DWR began buying power in January.  ??Typically, requests for rate increases, such as SDG&E's, goes through the PUC, which reviews such proposals and sets "reasonable" rates. But the law signed in January that gave the DWR the power to buy electricity also gave the agency the power to solely judge the merits of its own rate increase  proposals. The department has determined that the SDG&E is reasonable, spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said Monday.  ??How the rate hike will be distributed has not yet been determined, Hidalgo said. Under California law, residential customers will not see any rate  increase for using up to 130 percent of their baseline amounts. Low-income households also are exempt.

They will proceed with dispatch risk rule  changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron  will be able to live with these rule changes, the final wording of which we  should see on Monday, 2) We  have set up a meeting with the Minister of  Resource Development (you, Rob Milnthorp and I will attend) on December 11 to  encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course, and 3) This week we will  finalize our "Lessons from other Jurisdictions" document (that Steve sent me  materials to include in) and will provide it to the Alberta Government and  Power Pool and then follow up with them.     ---------------------- Forwarded by Robert Hemstock/CAL/ECT on 11/25/2000  11:52 PM ---------------------------   Robert Hemstock 11/25/2000 11:53 PM  Zufferli/CAL/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: aleck.trawick@blakes.com, dpef@blakes.com, Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT  Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes  The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's  further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears  the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from  setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of  suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too  high to clear the merit order.  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch  risk rule change on Monday.  Regards,  Rob

Subject:	FW: NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment  TJ Please forward to all East Power staff.  Thanks.       Subject:	NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  "Generating resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North America during the 2001/2002 winter season," says Michehl R. Gent, President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC).  "Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC Regions."  For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the 2001/2002 Winter Assessment is shown below.  A copy is also available on the following NERC web site: http://www.nerc.com/~filez/pressreleases.html  If you have any questions, let me know.  Sincerely,  Heather Gibbs   Contact: Ellen Vancko Evancko@nerc.com  November 20, 2001  NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment  Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  "Generating resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North America during the 2001/2002 winter season," says Michehl R. Gent, President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC).  "Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC Regions."  "Transmission systems in North America are also expected to perform reliably," he added, "although some transmission congestion is expected during the course of the winter."  According to the report, fuel supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20 percent greater than the same time last year.  The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.  For a copy of the 2001/2002 Winter Assessment, visit NERC's web site at (http://www.nerc.com).  NERC's web site also includes information on the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and activities.  *********************  NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric industry as well as customers to "keep the lights on" by developing and encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada, and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.
Hey. I had a question I wanted to ask you. I know you talked about taking the extra $10,000 you got and investing it for me. I was wondering if you were still going to do that or if you just took it and paid David. Even if you could give me the $4,000 left over after paying him $6,000 it would help. I'm kinda in a jam right now (between you and I) and I have some stuff I need to pay. I still owe Jay $5,500 for my car that he put on a credit card, and I have $4,000 of it, but if I give it all to him, that leaves me pretty broke. $27,000 of my money is stuck in my loan with the credit union, I paid mom like $2,000, paid off my credit, and have been making 2 car payments and 2 insurance payments since I still have the Neon. Even if you can only give me the $4,000 or even half of that...anything would help. I didn't know if you were still keeping that $10,000 for me or not, if you're not let me know. If you weren't, maybe you could lend me some money and I can pay you back...I'll be at work all day so E-Mail me back and let me know OK? Thanks. I love you. Ang

Jaime: Just wanted to update you on the call that I had this morning with Jose and  Pablo.  As a general matter, I think that we are going to be okay with  offering physical and financial derivative products to Mexican counterparties  online.  They are in the process of reviewing the online documents and will  get back to me sometime next week with any thoughts or recommendations.  One  area that we will need to be careful in is in how we market Enron Online for  there are restrictions in connection with the offering of "securities".   While it is fairly clear that commodity based derivatives are not securities   there may be other products where it is not so clear cut.  I think that it  would be very helpful if you would send to Jose and Pablo the Online  materials (i.e, brochures etc.) that we would plan to send to prospective  counterparties so that we can make sure that our marketing efforts don't  violate any restrictions taht we would be subject to.

Steffes (E-mail); Sue Mara (E-mail) Subject: RE: A.00-11-038 et al. ABAG POWER Petition for Modification of D.  01-05-064  I think ABAG has a good point and the principle is one we are also trying to  establish - if you weren't using DWR power, you shouldn't have to pay for  it.  But I wonder if Enron's endorsement of ABAG's petition wouldn't  contaminate it.  I think we should let them win on the merits of their own  argument and use their success (if it occurs) as precedent for our position  on similar issues.  Also, there is some downside if they win.  Our customers were on the utility  for those 3 months, and are now off - the direct opposite of the situation  ABAG is in.  So if they escape the burden of the 3 month surcharge, it would  (should) be reimposed on customers who were on the utility at that time -  which in theory could include our customers, even though they are back on DA  and otherwise exempt from the surcharge.  So while I think we want them to win, like always, its hard to figure if  that's good or bad so let's just stay out.

ABAG POWER Petition for Modification of D.  01-05-064 Importance: High  Attached is a petition for modification of Decision 01-05-064 (the rate design decision) filed by the Association of Bay Area Governments. The Petition requests that the decision be modified to exempt customers which were direct access for the period of March through May 2001 from the 12 month procurement surcharge which is designed to allow the utilities to collect the three cent increase authorized by the March decision which then did not go into effect until June (i.e., collect the revenues foregone due to the time lag in implementation).  Given the fact that most of Enron's customers were on bundled service during the March-June time frame, I do not believe that the requested modification would provide them any benefit.

Sarah  Well written. I enjoyed reading the document.  A few comments:  1) I would stress the importance of demand response as a key success factor for the implementaion of wholesale markets. RTO participants discussed this topic and shared this view as well. You included some elements of this topic under the title "An Installed capacity requirement is not necessary" . It does  fit under this title, but I think it is more than that. Perhaps a separate item.  A few possible additional points: a) Demand response has been very limited so far, because customers have been under a regulatory shield: b) A few attempts to make load "see" correct prices have been very encouraging. There is still a long way to go, though. c) There has to be serious regulatory efforts and flexible market rules to expose demand to wholesale prices (e.g. DSB) d) Wholesale market will benefit in multiple ways, such as: (i) increased chances for the market to clear at all times (ii) mitigate price spikes - and as a consequence the need for caps; (iii) proxy for reserves e) It will take some time to get demand response. In the meantime, some interim measures may be necessary, such as the one we proposed in lieu of capacity payments (your footnote 11 to achieve a certain reserve adequacy level).  f) Even for this interim period, we do not support  caps. By not having caps, the rationale for capacity payment disappears. FERC will deal with market power, if any, on an ad-hoc basism, by not allowing market based rates, instead of caps. This is the approach MISO has been taking and we agreed with it.  2) What about including the text "A well designed RTO" as an attachment?  - the one recently prepared by Janel.  3) Hydro - I agree with your point that LMP may work in a  hydro based system.  The only difficulty is when you have multiple ownership in the same cascade. In that case, plants are not free to bid - there has to be a central coordination function on the river flow and reservoir management.  The "marginal"  price for the hydro does not come from a bidding process, but it is the shadow price of an optimization program. This very same price could be the basis for the LMP. Not a big deal. Hydro plants do not like LMP because, in general, they are far away from consumer centers and LMP with technical losses penalizes them a lot. We should stick to our point that LMP should be used across all RTOs.   4) Still on LMP on the northwest - (page 10, second paragraph). I agree that some idiosyncrasies of the hydro system have to be worked out. For example,  generation to accomodate the flow of the river minimum (or maximum) requirements. However, I would not call this "allowing bilateral contracts". I would call it accomodate "must run"  requirements caused by operational inflexibilities. (for example, if a run of river plant  decides to be merchant, it still should have  the right to declare itself inflexible and therefore run)  5) Still on LMP for hydro. I am assuming that the problem of multiple ownership in the cascade does not exist in the Northwest RTO. Steve Walton to confirm. Otherwise the solution is not so simple as the one described in the second paragraph on page 10. I think David suggested to use the NY example (I am not familiar with)  6) Capacity Payment - Page 12 - last paragraph. "Finally, any such program should not tie a capacity payment to a specitc generator (as a physical product)". I know what you meant, but it may lead to dubious  interpretations. It may convey the idea that players are not allowed to contract to avoid spike price exposures. If we were able to get property rights on reliability issues, the capacity fee discussion wouuld be a no-brainer.  I would eliminate the sentence.  7) Capacity Payment - Page 12 - last paragraph - our white paper on capacity (footnote 11) does not clearly say that the RTO should the purchasing agent during the interim period. It may be the case (provider of last resource), but we did not go that far in detailing the interim solution. What we can certainly say is that in the interim period the RTO should be responsible for system adequacy - plan reserves and make sure they are implemented across all Control Areas (as opposed to having each one of them working independently)  Sorry for the long e-mail. I hope it helps.  LM       Subject:	RTO Comments  Attached are draft RTO comments.

Based on the information below, I've taken the liberty to compile a  spreadsheet of active California-specific commercial gas customers residing  in the HP, STAT, and Altra databases.  Included in the data is contact  information, expiration dates, product, price, LDC, volumes, as well as  number of accounts.  Unfortunately STAT is the only database that allows  reporting on rate class.  I've included that information.  As a rule of  thumb, STAT generally houses the smaller commercial, HP, the medium  commercial, with Altra holding the industrial customers.

Sounds at least modestly promising and consistent  with Sempra's message that they "want to work to make the market better."   Following up on our call last week, and just to ensure that we're not saying  anything that gets cross-ways with anything you might be discussing with Ron  and Nancy, give me a jingle when you get a chance and let's compare notes.   In the past, Socalgas has done a good job of boring into the Company and  having different discussions with different folks.  Also, Greg, if you have at your fingertips the profile of our California  customer base by class in the aggregate---large industrial, commercial, small  commercial & rez---that would be extremely useful info to have (i.e., how  many, annual demand, average annual demand by class).  Finally, I'm assuming  that turning back customers as a result of credit problems or lack of  profitability is something we do on a consistent basis?  Thanks alot.

They are in charge of the Core Aggregation Transport program.   Ron and Nancy have been tasked to encourage customers to switch from the  utility.  I have been working with them to find ways in which they can  promote the program with their customers.  They told me that we have been losing core customers back to the utility at a  rate of 30 meters per month.  I asked them what they could do to help us hold  on to these accounts.  They might be willing to give us a contact that we  could have our customers who have decided to go back to the utility could  call who would explain the benefits of being with a marketer and identify  high prices as general market conditions.  I would have to make this request to them formally and would like to know if  CAD would make use of this resource if the Gas Co. would agree to make it  available.  Dave C.

They stand at the bar, drinking their beers and talking  quietly about cattle prices.  Suddenly a woman at a table behind them, who had been eating a sandwich,  begins to cough. After a minute or so it becomes apparent that she is in real  distress, and the cowboys turn to look at her.  "Kin ya swaller? asks one of the cowboys.  No, the woman shakes her head.  "Kin ya breathe?" asks the other.  The woman, beginning to turn a bit blue, shakes her head No again. The first  cowboy walks over to her, lifts up the back of her skirt, yanks down her  panties, and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her thigh up to the  small of her back.  This shocks the woman to a violent spasm, the obstruction flies out of her  mouth, and she begins to breathe again.  The cowboy walks back over to the bar and takes a drink of his beer. His  partner says, "Ya know, I'd heard of that there Hind Lick Maneuver, but, I  never seen anybody do it."

Meter 985688 recorded flow from March 14th to the end of the month, averaging around 130 per day.  The above deal has a zero volume in it, creating an allocation exception at that point.  Bob is out and this is a gathering point, so do you have any objection with me inserting a deal volume of 130 per day for that time period?  Thanks.
Hi Larry,  Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at  http://www.DSOURCEVA.com  I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to  consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially  below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.   This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.  We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present  to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the  primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.  With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the  actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not  necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages  less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat  weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both  diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut  classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter  of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest  diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter  codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence  ratings.  Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3%  reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess  specifications marked with ? below.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the  certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High  quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you  are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can  request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.  If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite  manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click  on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best  craftsmanship in the industry.

Personnel and organizational information needs at Enron are diverse and  changing.  It is critical to the success of Enron that this information be  accurate and reliable.  Please take a minute of your time and go to PeopleFinder and check your  information. Look for incorrect Cost Centers, current positions, mailstops  numbers (ours is 3271), misspelled names or change of name, etc.... (Keep in  mind that PeopleFinder is linked to the PEP system therefore it is very  important that all your information be accurate for midyear and end of year  reviews.)   If any changes need to be made please forward them to me.  Once we submit   the correct information,  HR will be notified in order for the changes to be  made into SAP and eventually into systems like PEP, Expertfinder, etc.  The  turnaround for these changes is 24 hours.  NOTE:  Assistants can make changes in PeopleFinder, but due to security  reasons we cannot make any changes in EHRonline.  Those changes can be made  only by you.  Thanks in advance for your help, Alex Saldana ext. 57389
The Enron Europe legal department has grown steadily over the five years  since Enron=01,s merchant business was introduced into the UK in 1995 and   continues to grow, currently comprising some thirty lawyers in four  countries. In order to align the legal department as closely as possible wi th  Enron Europe's business units, to streamline the management of the departme nt  and to clarify for all which lawyers within the department specialise in  which areas of Enron Europe=01,s activities, the following new groups withi n the  department will be created with effect from Tuesday 2nd January 2001, each   reporting to myself as General Counsel:    Asset Management and Origination / EES   Headed by Jon Chapman, this group will deal with all legal work relating to   Enron Europe=01,s existing and future asset positions (which include the TP L,  ETOL, Trakya, Sarlux and Nowa Sarzyna power stations and the Arcos project) ,  Enron=01,s retail power business: Enron Direct throughout Europe, and all E ES  business. This group will also handle human resource related matters.  Reporting to Jon will be Alan Black, Sarah Gregory, Chris Wood, Stephan  Dewald, Stephen Hands, Tim Underdown (in his TPL legal capacity) and Annett e  Patrick.   Finance / Continental Trading and Origination   Marcus Von Bock will head this group which will deal with Enron Global  Finance transactions (monetisation, securitisation and capital market relat ed  transactions) and all gas and power origination and trading matters  throughout continental Europe. Mark Elliott, Martin Rosell, Michael Schuh a nd  Michael Slade will report to Marcus.   Technology and Global Markets   Justin Boyd will head this group which will deal with all European work  relating to all of Enron=01,s internet based trading platforms, including E nron  OnLine, Enron Credit.com and Clickpaper.com. This group will also handle al l  Enron Global Markets=01, work in Europe, including weather, currency, equit y,  interest rate, FX, and commodity derivatives, crude and products, coal,  emissions, LNG and paper and pulp trading. Robert Quick, Rahul Saxena, Ian   Brungs and Lorna Jones will report to Justin.   UK Energy/Credit/Metals   Paul Simons will head this group which will deal with all UK power and gas   trading and origination transactions (including the effort to amend existin g  power contracts to ensure their viability in the new bilateral trading  market) all metals and softs related work and work originated by Enron  Credit.com. Adam Duguid, Denis O=01,Connell, Ed Cooper and Matt Dawson will   report to Paul.   As before:   - the Broadband Services Group continues to be headed by Mary Nell Browning   reporting to myself and to Kristina Mordaunt (General Counsel Enron Broadba nd  Services) in Houston;   - the Company Secretarial Group continues to be headed by Sue Kelly reporti ng  to me. Cindy Buckley reports to Sue; and   - the Regulatory Group continues to be headed by Jonathan Marsh, reporting  to  me. Jon Barrett and Julie Russell report to Jonathan.   A chart showing the new structure is attached for your information.   This restructing of the group will inevitably result in some work being  transitioned from the lawyer currently responsible to lawyers within the  appropriate group. This will be achieved gradually over time (beginning Q1   2001) so as to prevent any disruption to ongoing transactions.   Please join me in congratulating Jon, Marcus, Justin and Paul on their  expanded roles.    Mark Evans
Rick,  Some comments from Nick are attached below.  Nick's first comment reflects a general concern I had about the paper which  was it's treatment of imbalance settlement.  I would see this as one of the  essential elements of market design.  I've always felt that the  physical/financial distinction was slightly artificial because even with  "physical" contracts, power systems must have a means for cash settlement of  imbalances (in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to  contract volumes).  However, the paper does not really pick this up and in  section 3.1 implies that cash settlement might only be "feasible" in some  market structures.  I would have added imbalance settlement to section 2.1  which describes the fundamentals required for any market.  It would also help  to draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement.  At the same time I would have dropped the mention of "binding market rules"  from 2.1.  I'd see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the  operation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental  principle.  It's also not made clear in what sense these commitments are  binding.  Are they binding in a financial sense (in which case they are  covered by imbalance settlement) or somehow physically (either this is  unfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty  which is ruled out later in the paper).  I felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMP's/transmission  rights with other non-locational elements of market design, this makes it  difficult to follow in places.  It would be clearer to have the locational  elements addressed separately as an adjunct to the basic principles.  Centralised unit commitment is put up as an element of the model proposed.   As Nick hints at below, we wouldn't see this as an essential element of  market design.  Under NETA, individual participants commit their own units  with the SO only taking over full control at 3.5 hours out.  Even with  centralised commitment, I'm not convinced that simple bidding would be  superior to multi-part bids.  Much here depends on timescales, eg, a  day-ahead market with simple bids is more exposed to allocative inefficienc  than a continuous hourly market with simple bids.  Simple bidding was often  proposed for the Pool, but I think a single daily big would have increased  prices if two-shifting generators had not been able to reflect their start-up  and no-load costs separately.  (These elements were also gamed, although this  game eroded as competition increased.)  Specific UK sensitivities which you may want to finesse in the paper:  ? we've consistently opposed locational pricing because of our Teesside  positions.  Publicly we've argued that the proposals do not provide good  economic signals over sufficiently long time-periods to enhance allocative  efficiency and that the transactions costs outweigh any possible efficiency  gains (constraints only cost about o20m pa here).  Despite arguing our  commercial position, I'm quite happy with this approach and am genuinely  sceptical about the benefits of locational pricing in the UK.  This position  would of course change in much larger, sparse and less-interconnected  networks such as exist in parts of the US. ? Our fall back position is that any locational pricing scheme in the UK must  preserve pre-existing implied rights for generators, ie, grandfathering.  I  recognise that this can be a barrier to competition in some networks with  imcumbent market power, but I don't think that this is as big an issue in the  UK (where competition already exists) as it is on the Contintent and in the  US.  Hope these help, let me know if you want to discuss further.  Paul      Subject: Frontier Economics' Whitepaper  Paul,  Here's some comments on Frontier's whitepaper. Do you want to discuss them?   Section 3.1 The distinction between cash and physical settlement of forward contracts is  blurred. Under NETA contract settlement is achieved by contract notification  to Elexon. Even then a party doesn't need to deliver on the contract - it  could cash out at the imbalance price. However, in practice NETA is more  similar to physical settlement since imbalance price volatility means Parties  try to avoid imbalances.   Section 4.1.1 Decentralised commitment doesn't require parties to trade physical  transmission contracts.  LMPs would also allow decentralised commitment.  It  is difficult to imagine an efficient dispatch resulting from flowgate trading  unless there are few transmission constraints and hence few flowgates.   Simplified flowgates is the same as zonal LMPs.  Interim model (section 5) 1) It will be difficult to impose a single RTO design on the multitude of  jurisdictions in the US - because of the private stakes in the industry. 2) The proposed day-ahead market need not be run by the ISO.  It's not a unit  commitment since it may not result in a feasible unit commitment, and even if  it did Parties may deviate through imbalance trading.  Rather, day-ahead  trading could be left to the market to develop.  Generators would self commit  based on their own forecasts of spot prices for the following day and parties  could hedge their positions through day ahead contracts trading.  These  day-ahead energy contract markets would be based at hubs - leaving parties  with basis risk between the hub and their location.  Parties require some  means of heging the basis risk - financial transmission rights is a  possibility.  Competitive framework (section 6) 1) Demand side response reduces generators' market power.  Forward  contracting mitigates the effect of market power on both generators and  consumers, particularly the impact of short term market power. This may be an  argument for using HHIs to measure market power. 2) A move towards regulatory intervention every time the supply/demand  imbalance became tight would add to regulatory risk.  And it may deter new  entrants if such intervention prevents prices from rising. 3) With full retail competition there is no need to regulate suppliers'  forward contracting since suppliers can only pass on their competitive costs  to customers.  Non-eligible customers create a problem.  What price should  these customers pay?  It is difficult to regulate a supplier's contracts and  to somehow split its contract costs between eligible and non-eligible  customers.  This is why a spot price pass-through is suggested.  Financial  institutions would be free to provide hedging contracts to consumers. Those  institutions would in turn have financial contracts with generators.  An  alternative is incentive regulation of suppliers of non-eligible customers.   To avoid the california problem the regulator would need to limit the  supplier's downside and upside risk.  Nick
I submitted the following RCRs for CA: Intervention in Support of Strategic Energy Enron supported Strategic's complaint against the CA ISO, regarding its  request to require the ISO release OOM (out of market) data publicly. ENA  (Tim Belden) has always had as a number one priority, release more data  sooner, and this filing offered an opportunity promote that concept.  The  filing was made on 3/20/01.  Opposition to ISO Compliance Filing On Creditworthiness Standards The ISO made a compliance filing that greatly expands its creditworthiness  exemptions, far beyond what FERC had ordered in its 2/14/01 order.  The ISO's  tariff language can be read to allow the utilities to count the credit status  of third parties as their own, without the third parties' approvals.  Enron  will oppose.  The filing is due 3/22/01.  Also Bracewell is making or has made the following CA filings (these are all  I know about anyway):  Tucson Electric Complaint   Intervention -- vanilla 3/19   Done for Sanders  -- no RCR PNM Complaint   Support   3/22 Done for Sanders -- no RCR FERC Staff Report  Support EPSA/WPTF 3/22 Plan to do for <$500 and raise temporal issue of western resources City of San Diego  Intervene/comment 3/28 Probably will be done for Sanders  The underscheduling filing was put on hold.  We were mistaken when we thought  that comments on an ISO proposal were due 3/22.   Instead, we've now decided  to file comments in response to the ISO's filing of tariff changes, which  should be made soon.  That's all for the rest of March, so far.  I'll be updating Jim's table on  pending FERC matters.  Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854

I would suggest we avoid getting involved in any acquisition effort at  present, although it would be worth establishing avaluation for the storage  and the brand.  All our experience so far with Spanish law suggests due  diligence shouldn't be undertaken unless we are serious, and that it  will be  impossible to transact in less than  3 months if that.

Gentlemen -  We are working on a non-disclosure agreement with BEA Systems Inc., a  software company.  The basis for the NDA is the disclosure to BEA of the EOL  software and discussions concerning a possible transaction involving either  the purchase or long term license of the software.  This possible transaction  is in association with an ongoing project by ENW involving the EOL software.  The original NDA provided to BEA contained a unilateral non-solicitation  provision.  BEA responded with a bilateral provision that sought to reach  beyond BEA and ENW.  I have provided the attached language to BEA for their  review.  They have subsequently approved the language.    Basically, the attached is our standard non-solicitation provision, but has,  as a caveat, a statement that the non-solicitation is only applicable to BEA  and ENW, and not affiliates/subsidiaries or parent companies.  At your convenience, please let me know if the attached is acceptable for the  BEA non-disclosure agreement.  If any of you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Enron At A Glance is an opportunity for 3-6 month employees to learn  information about the individual business units.  March 1st will mark the  third edition of the newly designed orientation.  Based on audience feedback,  the New Hire Network Team is searching for creative ways to engage the  audience and encourage deeper conversation on the stage.    The Enron Wholesale Interview needs to focus on broad contributions to Enron,  general business processes, and 2001 goals. Most of the wholesale business  units have sent speakers to discuss their specific commodities, goals, and   contributions to EWS. Enron Networks  Beth Perlman Enron Industrial Markets Tammy Mulrooney Enron Global Markets Mike McConnell You may notice Enron Americas and Europe are not included.  Their speakers  are unavailable.  Thus, I will ask questions about the gas and power industry  as well as examples of initiatives in Europe.   We will also follow your interview with several pre-recorded interviews with  lead commodity traders (i.e. Hunter Shively, Janet Dietrich, Dave Duran,  etc).  They will focus on the trading responsibilities.  I will be interviewing you on stage.  During your interview, we will be  interrupted by "Late Breaking News" concerning power peaker issues and  describing how Enron makes money with this initiative.  This is a 4-5 minute  pre-recorded video that runs on the screens behind our interview area.  You  will not need to contribute anything to this video.  Here are the questions I have written.  Please give your feedback.  (1)  Greg, you came to Enron in 1992 while the gas market was deregulating  and the power market was moving towards deregulation.  Tell us what you  experienced during this time. (a)  What risks did Enron take then? (b)  Did the Enron leaders have a real idea of amount of opportunities that  would open the gas and power markets? (c)  What was the atmosphere at Enron during this time?  Excitement?   Frustration?  High Egos? (d)  Do you think that EES and EBS are experiencing the same type of  excitement while they forge into undiscovered markets?  Interruption:  ENA Investigative Report (Part 1) - Late Breaking News  (2)  In 1996, you moved into the European market and lead the trading  divisions in the oil and refined products.   (a) What was the atmosphere like in the International arena? (b)  Has the atmosphere changed over the last 5 years? (c)  What are some initiatives that are hot in Europe?  (3)   Enron is entering the Japanese market.  They are focusing on the power,  foreign exchange and metal markets. (a)  What are their goals in these markets? (b)  What are their challenges this year?  in the next 3 years? (c)  What other opportunities area arising in Japan?  (4)  Enron Wholesale Services was created and announced in November 2000. (a)  What was the business purpose for this formation? (b)  What accomplishments/successes  have been made already? (c)  What is the business model for EWS? (d)  What characteristics does a market need to interest EWS?  (5)  Finally, EWS and its business units have been losing its intellectual  capital, its people resources, to the other divisions of Enron such as EBS  and EES.   (a)  What characteristics are you looking for in future employees (b)  Recruiting is offering a $5000 incentive to Enron employees referring  people with trading skills.  What are your needs in this area?  Conclusion of interview:  You will exit the stage while I set up the audience  for Part 2 of the Investigative Report.  Thanks for your time.

I need your list of accomplishments (five to ten items) for calendar year  2000 by the close of business next Tuesday, December 5.  Thank you.
On Friday night we discovered that the planned maintenance at Palo Verde for  Sunday was  a "go" again.     The cash traders/preschedulers had been told  that the work was cancelled.  R. Slinger and Leaf rerouted 150mw's of onpeak energy  that was routed/tagged  to go to the PX,   saving the company $48,096.   The PX cleared for zero's  much of the onpeak hours, as there was major cong. at PV.    They sold to LA  directly 100 mw's and also booked out 50mw's with the generator (TEP) of one  of the preschedules.    Our desk retained the majority of the savings, as  indicated below.  This was a good exercise,   as it demonstrates how we can "jump chain" on  certain curtailed paths and settle directly with the generator's to avoid  inadvertancy.   This was done and the system balanced perfectly.  Good job!!

We also booked out 50mw's at $50 with TEP - see deal  #440642.      For ease of accounting,  these sales were entered under your book,  ST SW,   so you are flat for this day.  The P/X onpeak average was, as I calculated,  $21.96. The wt. avg price of the bookout/ sales agreements was $42.   The net,  of  course,  is $20.04.  Enron saved:  $20.04 * 150mw's  * 16 hrs =  $48,096  Our split was 70%,  so we should enter an annuity for this amount,   $33,667.20.  If you agree,  let me know and I will enter the deal.   Thanks for the "heads up."  This was a good call for the company.   JMF

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.    Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.  I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.  Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.
I think permitted transfers are those where the credit support is the same  (Enron Corp gty covers affiliate we transfer to).  In this case, FUNB could  transfer to an affiliate if they were willing to gty the obligations of the  affiliate (since it is the parent, in essence).      Subject: First Union National Bank ("FUNB")/Enron Corp. ISDA Master Agreement  Tanya:  For purposes of "Transfer", shall we permit both parties to transfer to  Affiliates?  Would FUNB require a guaranty?  Or do we feel strongly that  neither party should have the ability to transfer except with the written  consent of the other party?

This story was sent to you by vkaminski@aol.com with these comments:  From CBS.MarketWatch.com, online at:http://aolpf5.marketwatch.com/news/stor y.asp?siteID=3Daolpf&guid=3D{2B94A9E8-D298-4858-AB83-E8367AED9C8F}    Avoiding the shock in utility stocks     By Myra P. Saefong, CBS.MarketWatch.com  1:00 AM ET May 31, 2001 Newswa tch More Headlines       SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Fund manager Greg Phelps has just the right weapo n to stave off the short circuit in utility stocks: an investment strategy  that helps him see the future.  When choosing utility stocks for the $225 m illion John Hancock Patriot Select Dividend Trust [DIV ], Phelps takes a lo ok at three key issues: dividend yield and sustainability, management and r egulatory environment.  His strategy has helped the 11-year old, closed-end fund see a net asset value return of 17.21 percent year-to-date and 4.51 p ercent on a 3-year annualized basis, according to Lipper. The Philadelphia  Utility Index [$UTY ] has risen about 20 percent over the past year.  Phelp s' investment preferences have also kept him away from investing in Califor nia's cash-starved utilities, Edison International [EIX ] and PG&E Corp. [P CG ].  It's been years since the Select Dividend Trust Fund has been expose d to any California utility, Phelps said.   "I never felt comfortable with  the regulatory environment in California," he said, emphasizing his nervous ness over the fact that Edison and PG&E agreed to have their rates capped a nd could not pass on the higher cost of electricity to their customers.   P helps believes Florida provides a good regulatory environment for utilities because its high temperatures and above average population growth means it will have to build out its electric utility infrastructure and transmissio n distribution system and create new generating capacity.   Since electrici ty is such an integral part of the state's economy, Florida has typically t reated its utilities very well, he said, giving them reasonable allowed ret urn on equity and the ability to pass through costs.  Using this outlook on the electric industry, Phelps believes Alliant Energy Corp. [LNT ] is a gr eat pick. It has an attractive dividend yield. It's also in a favorable reg ulatory environment mostly in Wisconsin and Iowa and is a probable consolid ation candidate. The stock closed Wednesday at $30.15, off one penny.  Phel ps' second pick would be TECO Energy [TE ] because it has a "great track re cord" of increasing its dividends -- at least 10-straight years -- and its  located in Florida. It also has a profitable and growing coal mining and tr ansportation operation as a unregulated subsidiary, he added, noting that c oal is a big part of President Bush's energy plan. Shares of the company cl osed at $31.73, up 15 cents on Wednesday.  Finally, Kansas City Power and L ight [KLT ] boasts a higher-than-average dividend yield, much like Alliant  Energy. It's also located very close to where Warren Buffet's main utility  operations are so it could potentially be on his "shopping list." The compa ny has earnings growth potential with its new generating plants coming on l ine for this summer. Phelps also likes the company's move to build out its  fiber optic subsidiary. On Wednesday, shares closed at $25.09, up 14 cents. Myra P. Saefong is a reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com in San Francisco.
John thought you might be interested in the following from the credit markets....  Play by play during the call on the 5yr Enron Credit Default Swaps from Morgan Stanley:  1.  5Y BIDS GETTING HIT ON OPENING AS EARNINGS NEWS LOOKED LIKE CLEANING HOUSE.  250. 2.  DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL; WHICH APPARENTLY WAS UNCLEAR, TICKED OUT 255,260,265. 3.  LAY INDICATED NEAR END OF CONFERENCE "NO RATINGS ACTION ANTICIPATED".   MINUTE CONFERENCE ENDED MOODY'S WATCH NEWS RELEASED.  280 BID. 4.  LAY ALSO MENTIONED 3Q NEG CASH FLOW DUE TO SOME CONTRACT ROLLOFF.  UNCLEAR MESSSAGE. 5.  ENE SAYS COMMITTED TO "INV GRADE" RATHER THAN "A"  280/325   Summary from Morgan Stanley after the call:  CREDIT DERIVATIVE UPDATE:  ENRON CORP  AFTER THE NEWS THIS AM ($1 BIL. CHARGE), THE COMPANY HOSTED A CALL AT 10AM NY TIME.   THE CALL DID NOT GO WELL & ENRON SPREADS ARE HEADING WIDER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE LAND.  MKTS ARE SPOOKED B/C:  1) MOODY'S WATCHLISTED CO NEGATIVE, 2) ENE STATED "THEY ARE COMMITED TO INVESTMENT GRADE RATING," WHICH IS A CHANGE FROM THE SINGLE-A BOGEY THEY ONCE EXTOLED, 3) CO. DID NOT ADDRESS ALL LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND 4) MORE CHARGES COMING? 5YR MARKETS:  ENE (PRE-WTC):   165/185        ENE (8AM TODAY): 240/260 ENE (WEEK AGO):  250/300      **ENE NOW:         275/350  Clearly the above are a function of what people think they heard...I did not alter any of the email.  In general MSDW likes Enron credit but this is how they see the market.  Enron is one of the most actively traded names in the credit derivative market.  Let me know if you want updates as the market gets more clarity and works throught the details

Ben,  I spoke to Ross Newlin regarding the vibration problems.  The Westinghouse  engineers corrected the problem to the point that it was below alarm limits.   There is no plan to repair the problem during the November outage since it  requires significant run time and the economics are not there for a November  run.  However, West. has committed to come back to the plant in January when  we can schedule some run time.  Ross will try to track down the minutes of  the outage planning meeting to document this.  I'll forward them to you when  I get them.   Rick      Benjamin Rogers@ECT 10/25/2000 10:36 AM  cc:    Subject:   Rick: Here are some questions we are working on where we need a little assistance.

Steve from El Paso called.  When you email the actuals for El Paso he would  like to recieve them as well.  any questions give him a call.
Admittedly , ERCOT was handled poorly from a pleading submission perspective,  but there is a legitimate discussion going on within the company that , at  the very least,  will result in a more flexible approach to market structure  and , perhaps( this is my preference) will result in a sharpening and  refocusing of our positions that will acknowledge the necessity for an  "LMP"-like approach in real-time to achieve sufficient depth of liquidity.(  with a keen focus on developing forward markets in transmission rights).   Airing our differences and doubts externally creates absolutely no benefit -  At the end of the day, we're here ( no matter where we end up on this issue)  to enhance the company's commercial success, not to win an ideological  battle. I understand and value the passion people in our group bring to their  work... I don't want to lose that "fire", but merely want to assure that it  is properly directed. We will resolve this issue shortly and am quite  sure  we will all work hard to ensure uniformity of message at that time.     Susan J Mara 02/21/2001 06:15 PM  cc: eschmid@caiso.com, dhawk@caiso.com, alexp@eccointl.com,  harry.singh@neg.pge.com (bcc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron)  Subject: Re: FW: Enron's recent filing at ERCOT    Ziad   and Elena and Diane and Alex,  It is not exactly true -- but I can see how people got that idea.  Enron has  decided to withdraw the filings we made in ERCOT. Our position on the ERCOT  market structure is being reviewed.    Enron continually goes through a process of reviewing its policies to make  sure they are consistent with our business needs.  I can tell you that there  are some strong supporters of Hogan's policies INSIDE Enron now and these  supporters are finding an ear.    Currently, we are reviewing the positions we are taking on market structure  in ERCOT and the east.  We have to ensure we are practical -- from a business  point of view -- and not being just religious about our views.  Probably the  number one concern of the business people is the ability to have a deep,  liquid market for trading.  I believe that much of the discussion has focused  on the ways in which we can achieve such a market.    After our review of ERCOT, Enron may indeed support a PJM-like structure for  the real-time market, but the filings we make will likely not imply that this  approach be implemented everywhere.  I expect that we will be free to support  different approaches in different parts of the country, depending on the  evolution of the markets in each location.  What does this mean for our position in California?  So far, nothing.  We are  standing firm on our California position, supporting the ISO and  stakeholder-approved approach for congestion management, and do not have any  plans to make new proposals. Further, we have the support of the Traders on  this.  Please feel free to call with any concerns. Believe me, I'm having just as  hard of a time working through this as you all are.

Enron, one of the main advocates of the zonal/flowgate model, has a change of heart.  After putting their weight behind the zonal model since 1995, now they are abandoning it unceremoniously. I talked to Richard Tabors today and he confirmed that Enron, his main client, has turned around 180 degrees on this issue. It is all the work of Ron McNamara, a key Enron person in the ERCOT and the Eastern ISO markets. In fact Enron is bringing next week to the PUCT hearings in Texas no other than Bill Hogan himself. ERCOT is way down the path of the zonal model and they have almost completed the implementation of the zonal model, but these recent developments add substantial uncertainty to the final outcome of that market.  Alex         Subject: Enron's recent filing at ERCOT   Hi Gregory,  Attached is Enron's recent PUCT filing on the ERCOT Protocols. This has to be the greatest (shameless) turnaround that I've seen. The reason I say shameless is that during the congestion management development sessions in ERCOT, they wouldn't even let us discuss PJM-like market structures and actually succeeded in making "PJM" a dirty word in these sessions.  Anyway, I thought you might find the attached interesting.  Regards, Shams  - 23220_143 feb5 enron's reply brief.tif - 23220_125 jan26 enron's brief.tif

This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge  interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please  let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.   Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.    Lisa King 11/15/2000 02:19 PM  cc:   Subject: Ice Drilling  John-  Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been  updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and  the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being  compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple  interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89  (October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based  on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due  is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with  my thinking.  Thank you, Lisa
I don't have a problem with not back dating it. I'll see if there's a  sesitivity to it from ABB's side.     Herman Manis 07/06/2000 08:06 AM  cc:    Subject: ABB Agreement for Review  If possible, regarding comment for section 7.1, could we make the date  current?  Back dating to the first option agreement may be construed to be a  deposit.

This is not a GE requirement  and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture  much more expensive to finance.  Purchase Agreement: Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds  from. 2.1(B):  It should be "Agent's" person to approve change orders, not  "Purchaser's" 2.2:  "Purchaser" should be used rather than "WestLB" since it is not as  limiting. 7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option  agreement execution date? Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three  purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest  Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of  the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option  Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of  the transformers.

As I said yesterday it is my understanding that we need Dynegy's permission in order to engage in such discussions.  I however have not seen the final merger documents so I may be mistaken.  Given Dynegy's presentation to the analysts on Monday it doesn't look like the want to divest of the pipes.  This is Greg's call.       Subject:	  Greg, Jeff and Stan:  I just received a call from David Dehaemers at Kinder, Morgan.  They are interested in buying Transwestern and offered to have Rich call Ken - but I waived that off in order to get a read from you all.  With respect to the merits, if a preferred at the pipe level is being treated as effectively debt by the rating agencies, a sale is roughly equivalent to a preferred with respect to both ratings and liquidity.  In addition, the sale should provide greater proceeds due to lower cost of funds and may have a higher probability of success.  One key issue will be funding the sale at signing or HSR rather than regulatory approval.  I first wanted to test you three, and if supportive, determine the best path upon which to proceed including gaining Dynegy's consent.  Jeff
Some initial comments:    Will Barnett/Wood/CPUC really care if we can't "work off" the credit?  I  suspect they will be delighted.  Therefore shouldn't we delete section I(C)  and rely on the arguments that (1) the Proposed Decision misconstrues the  Stipulation (can we flesh this out some?  can we submit an affidavit by those  who negotiated it?);  (2)  that it is contrary to the parties' own course of  performance (I think we need to use this legal terminology); and (3) that it  goes beyond what SCE requested in its filing and so violates fundamental  principles of due process (notice and an opportunity to be heard) and perhaps  CPUC procedures or practices (Jeanne?).  Are there any CPUC precedents we  could cite relating to arguments (2) and (3)?

Congratulations on the new house, a job you love, and the baby on the way. Do you remember Chou? (my dog)  You're never going to believe this...but she turns 18 on January 3rd.  I think she found the fountain of youth somewhere and never told me about it. but told the other animals...the rabbit's 8 1/2, 2 of my birds are pushing 9yrs, etc.  (little lovebirds...I think 9 yrs is really unexpected for them...guess the birds aren't aware of that. :) )  If you hadn't told me what Enron does, I wouldn't have ever known.  I've never heard of them.  Are they local to Houston?  Very cool that you and Patrick (Pat?) were set up on a blind date...proof that those work sometimes!  Well, believe it or not, I still have a little bit of Xmas shopping to do, so I better go.  Talk to you soon.  Heather

Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse  click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should  have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously allocated.                     The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes. lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

Enron is initially using its existing 14,000-mile fiber optic > network in the U.S., along with pooling points and other points of > presence, currently in 25 U.S. cities. > > The concept is revolutionary. Currently high-bandwidth pipelines (DS-3 and > higher) are provisioned on a long-term contract basis and can take up to > 90 days to be brought into service. This means that it is very difficult > for networks to do any dynamic load management because their networks must > be built to handle peak usage times that, in some instances, can be 200 > times as high as the low usage points. > > Enron estimates as a result of this that even on the heaviest trafficked > routes, such as New York-Los Angeles, that the load factor (amount of > capacity that is actually used) for circuits is less than 5%. What Enron > is proposing would provide a way for network managers to use as much > bandwidth as they need during peak times, and sell it on the open market > during their own lower traffic times. But how can companies do this given > the long lead times required to bring up and tear down circuits? > > Enter Enron. Enron has built its first two pooling points (one in New > York, one in Los Angeles) to which ISPs, carriers and high-density end > users can connect. These pooling points can then, using Enron's network > optimization protocols, route the traffic from any number of customers > across the same network. In so doing, Enron has provided its customers a > solution that would otherwise be unavailable to them -- the ability to > efficiently provision their own bandwidth needs, on a time-of-day, hourly, > or one-time purchase basis. > > So, for example, if Citigroup (NYSE: C) > <http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=C> needed to send wiring > information out from its New York clearinghouse once a day from 2-3am, > Enron could provide them dedicated bandwidth for that transaction, selling > the capacity to other clients during the other 23 hours of the day. Enron > can even "hot roll" a data stream, matching supply and demand every 5 > seconds, and move a customer from one dedicated circuit to another without > any disruption of service to the customer. > > There is a great deal of things that need to take place in the market > before this vision becomes real, such as terms of service standards, legal > efficiency (master contracts), and an increased level of interconnectivity > between carriers. But more importantly, carriers need to be willing to > change the rules of the game. At least one carrier has been dismissive of > Enron's entrance into their sandbox, saying that there's nothing an Enron > could teach them about their own business.

Here's the latest info. about the FERC meeting.  Only Commissioners and their Staffs will be attending, no additional FERC Staff (no one from the Office of Markets and Tariff Rates).  The Meeting is mostly an opportunity for customers to blow off steam.  Presentations will be made by the three IOUs, one  generator, one marketer (Enron) and one ESP, UCAN, and various politicians.  When I get  the list I'll forward it.  Each presenter will have about five minutes with no questions from the audience.  Panelists should expect questions and discussion among panelists or in response to Commissioner's questions.  Attached is the latest FERC notice about the California meeting.  It  recognizes that there may be discussions about pending FERC cases.  This does not mean  FERC will be grilling our panelist about these cases.  Rather, FERC has to issue  this notice so if someone talks about an issue pending in one of those cases, the Commissioners don't violate the government in the sunshine rules.

As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.  1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T) 2.  PACW to IPC(T)@Enterprise(ENPR) on PAC(T) 3.  IPC@ENPR to PAC(T)@Borah Brady(BOBR) on IPC(T) 4.  IPC@BOBR to Four Corners(FC3) on PAC(T) 5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.  I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.   Enjoy,  Slinger
Mr. Lay,  I have received the proposal from Gulstream and will drop it off  today.  As you probably already know, the flight from Beijing was a record  first for the GV into Houston.  I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a  total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith  Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well  as our thoughts and recommendations.  Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good  two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have  overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the  program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.  Worldwide  support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the  Global Express.  Bombardier is still looking forward to demonstrating their aircraft to you on  your India trip in December.  All of us at the department stand ready to do whatever you feel necessary to  support Enron into the new millennium.
Harry,  Thank you for taking time last week to meet with me and for arranging the other meetings as well.  I enjoyed our discussion and learning about the various opportunities within Enron.  I have been impressed with every group at Enron.  I hope that we can keep in touch over the next few months.  Thank you again.

Because I will not be able to attend the Governance workshop (it conflicts with congestion management and ancillary services working groups), I'd like to provide you some input via this e-mail.

At the Governance Workshop on June 14, Alan Davis suggested that it would be helpful, for purposes of determining the appropriate approach to governance of the RTO, to review the principles that have been established with respect to the governance of the Western Interconnection Organization (WIO).  An except from the most recent draft of the WIO proposal, which includes a general overview, mission statement, committee structure description, and description of the organization of the WIO Board of Directors and the membership classes that are entitled to vote for directors, has been posted on the RTO West web site.  It can be found by going to the Legal Work Group page, clicking on the link to working subgroup information, and then clicking on the link to the Bylaws, Articles and RTO Tax Status Subgroup.  The exact URL address is of the document is http://208.55.67.64/Bylaws_Subgroupage.htm.  Also at the last Governance Workshop, John Buechler of the New York ISO agreed to provide us with a summary of board member qualifications that have been devised in the context of various other existing or proposed ISOs.  You should have received John's report a couple of weeks ago from Barney Speckman.  In case not, however, a copy of Barney's e-mail, to which John's report is attached, is attached below.  At Tuesday's Governance Workshop, I would propose that we address at least the following topics:  1. Appropriate number and scope of RTO membership classes for election of members of Board of Trustees (remember that the board is proposed to be an independent, non-stakeholder body).  2. Appropriate method of selecting members of RTO Technical Advisory Committee (remember that the TAC, unlike the RTO board, is proposed to be a stakeholder body).  3. Appropriate qualifications requirements for the members of the Board of Trustees.  4. Consideration of appropriate conflict of interest standards for the members of the Board of Trustees and RTO employees.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.  Eric  - NWRTO-govissues-070800.rtf

O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 - Phone 512-795-8536  Sonny Davis Awaiting Test Score; Barnum Watch Ongoing  DT Sonny Davis is amazed by all the internet speculation that he is headed for junior college, and he says it isn't necessarily so. "I haven't got my test score back yet," he said Tuesday from California, where he is training with the Texas All-Star team that will meet the California All-Stars Saturday night. If he makes a qualifying score, Davis said he will be in a Longhorn uniform this fall. If he doesnt, well, that's why he signed a letter of intent with Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, a Mississippi junior college. "That's my backup plan," Davis said. "I don't know yet what I am going to do." Davis has enough core courses to qualify and just needs a qualifying test score. * * * * Greg Barnum, the Killeen Ellison center who was being touted as an All-America prospect at Tennessee this season before quitting the team, says he probably will enroll at Texas or Stephen F. Austin in September to continue his football career. Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer has refused to release Barnum to Texas, but has said he will release him to Stephen F. Austin. Without a release, Barnum would have to pay his own way for a year if he enrolls at Texas. I'd like to see somebody challenge a coach's right to refuse to release a kid. Scholarships are renewable now on a year-to-year basis, so Fulmer or any other coach can get rid of a player by simply refusing to renew his scholarship. If a school can fire a player, then it's only fair that a player be able to fire the school. I know it's an NCAA rule, but there is a thing called the U. S. Constitution that takes precedence over NCAA rules. * * * * Texas has two great DTs in All-America Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers, but there is one at Blinn JC who might be just as good. He is Paul Broussard, formerly of La Porte, which is Shaun Rogers' home town, too. Broussard was a great DT as a sophomore at La Porte when he weighed about 280, but he ballooned up to well over 300 pounds as a junior and senior and was not as dominating. He is about 6-4 and was back in the 290-pound range last year as a freshman at Blinn, and he was outstanding. He's working in Austin this summer. If his academics are in order, let's hope Alfio Randall, the big OT at Blinn who plans to enroll at UT next January, can talk Broussard into coming along with him. * * * * RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns have apparently stepped up their recruiting of running backs. In addition to offering Anthony Johnson of Jefferson last week, the UT coaches are now actively recruiting Cedric Benson of Midland Lee, who is on the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football magazine, and Jabari Davis of Tucker, Ga.. . . Six Longhorn recruits were scheduled to play in the All-Star game in California Saturday night, but WR B. J. Johnson of South Grand Prairie is nursing a sprained ankle and had to withdraw. In addition to Sonny Davis, the other future Longhorns are WRs Roy Williams of Odessa Permian and Sloan Thomas of Klein, DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St. Mark's and center Jason Glynn of Richardson Berkner. That game is supposed to kick off at about 9 p.m. Texas time and is supposed to be televised by Fox in most areas of Texas. * * * * FOOTBALL NOTES: Another internet rumor that has no substance, but has great interest for Longhorns and Red Raiders is the one that has former Tech coach Spike Dykes going to work for Texas. Since Spike is still under contract with the Red Raiders, it would cost him well into six figures to go to work for the Longhorns. It might happen down the road, but not anytime soon. I normally don't comment on internet rumors, but I have had so many queries about Sonny Davis and Spike Dykes that I just decided to give the facts to all of you. . . Sophomore DE Adam McConathy, who weighed about 230 last season, is up to 252 pounds and hasn't lost any of his speed. He is battling Jermain Anderson and Maurice Gordon for the starting job at right end. All three are outstanding pass rushers, and the coaches want them to get a little bigger so they can do a better job against the run. . . If Sonny Davis does wind up going to a junior college, freshman  Stevie Lee and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs will back up Hampton and Rogers at DT this year and they will be the guys to beat for the starting jobs in 2001. Barring an injury, I don't think anyone will beat out Stevie Lee. * * * * My next fax will be whenever events warrant. * * * * The True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs $99 ($79 by E-Mail).

Spokesman for California's Davis Sells His Shares of Calpine By David Ward  Sacramento, Aug. 2 (Bloomberg) -- A spokesman for California Governor Gray Davis, criticized for owning shares in power generator Calpine Corp., has  sold the stock, the governor's office said.  Davis's interim communications director Steve Maviglio sold the 300 shares of Calpine that he had purchas ed last month, said Deputy Press Secretary Hilary McLean.  Republicans and  public-interest groups criticized Maviglio for purchasing the stock while t he Davis administration was negotiating long-term energy contracts with Cal pine and promoting the company's efforts to build power plants in Californi a.  ``He (Maviglio) felt it was becoming a distraction,'' McLean said.  Mav iglio said that he had purchased 300 shares of Calpine at $40 each on June  20, after putting in an order on May 31. He denied any conflict of interest and said the stock was sold earlier this week.  Shares of San Jose, Califo rnia-based Calpine rose 76 cents to $36.76 in midafternoon trading. They ha d dropped 9.7 percent from June 20 to yesterday's close.  Maviglio won't be fired or reprimanded for the purchase, McLean said. He won't comment on an y conflict-of-interest issues before the administration, she said.  Republi cans and public interest groups have criticized Davis after disclosures tha t some advisers and consultants to the state on energy matters owned shares in companies that are trading electricity or negotiating long-term power c ontracts with California.  California in January stepped in and began buyin g power for its two largest utilities, which are insolvent after running up more than $15 billion in debt because of a shortage of power plants and fl aws in the state's deregulation law.

It is an old agreement from 1994 so I don't think we are losing anything.  The payment terms were 20th day of the month and the WSPP is later of 10 days after receipt or 20th day of the invoice month, so I'm not sure they are getting better payment terms.  Thanks for the info.       Subject:	Chelan PUD Master    Rhonda:  I am forwarding via inter-office mail a letter from Chelan PUD cancelling our old master power purchase and sale agreement.

California is electric industry test case      By Deborah Adamson, CBS.MarketWatch.com Last Update: 3:03 PM ET Aug 23, 2000  NewsWatch Latest headlines  SAN DIEGO (CBS.MW) -- The federal government will provide grants and loans to  help local residents and businesses pay for soaring electricity bills,  President Clinton said Wednesday. Clinton said $2.6 million will be earmarked to help low-income families and  seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled. He urged the  Small Business Administration to provide loans to companies that are  struggling to pay power bills. He also called for expediting the investigation of wholesale power markets by  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. "We'll do what we can to help you," the president said during a televised  news conference at the White House in Washington. Test case yields public outcry The San Diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the  feasibility of electric industry deregulation. The region -- which also  encompasses South Orange County, north of San Diego -- is the first in the  nation to have its power market completely deregulated.  New York, New England and mid-Atlantic states are following suit, and they're  watching California carefully. Thus far, the San Diego test has turned out to be a shambles. Electricity supply that hasn't increased in 10 years failed this summer to  meet strong demand resulting from a growing state. With market forces in play  for the first time, strong demand led to much higher wholesale rates that was  passed along to residents. After a public outcry, the California Public Utilities Commission on Monday  approved a plan that would cap customers' electric bills for normal use, but  they'll pay market rates for anything extra. Utility companies also can  collect on any shortfalls later.            Today on CBS MarketWatch Nasdaq inches higher; Dow lags Oil inventories at 24-year low Commentary: Garzarelli sees stock rally in fourth quarter Amazon.com enters car market California is electric industry test case More top stories... CBS MarketWatch Columns Updated: 8/23/2000 3:02:08 PM?ET     In other words, if the electric company can't pass along the entire cost of  buying the energy for now, they'll be able to pass it along months later.  Therefore, people who are used to seeing lower electricity bills for the  cooler months in fall and winter won't see much of a drop-off. "It's a shameful pay-now-or-pay-later plan," said Bob Finkelstein, staff  attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group.  "California jumped off the deregulation cliff." State legislators, which have the power to expand on the commission's ruling,  shelved a plan to roll back rates to mid-1999 levels and cap them for  customers of San Diego Gas & Electric, a Sempra Energy (SRE: news, msgs)  subsidiary. They faced opposition from Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and from  Republican lawmakers. Davis prefers a plan that would cut rates by 60 percent immediately but that  would stipulate customers pay the full amount of what they owe later.  Republican lawmakers want the state to use taxpayers' money to help pay  electric bills for consumers while businesses get tax credits. San Diego fiasco The Southern California fiasco came about as a result of a deregulated  electricity market that began two years ago. The effects of deregulation are  being felt first in the San Diego area because it was the first to end its  rate freeze -- last summer. The rest of California should follow, region  after region, by 2002.  The idea sounded good: Deregulate the electric industry and let the market  set the prices. With competition, rates should come down and service should  improve. When the long-distance phone market was deregulated, it did bring  about low prices and greater competition. But things got messed up along the way. For one, the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for  electricity as they shop for better deals among long-distance carriers was  dashed, at least for now. Initially, hundreds of companies had signed up to  offer power but most have gone out of business or left the market. Of the  remaining companies, most serve the more lucrative corporate market, said  Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman at Consumer Action. Also, the strategy of letting housing developments form power cooperatives  and negotiate better rates "didn't pan out," Sherry said. Demand far outstrips supply Demand for power in California surged as businesses and the population grew.  But supply didn't grow with it because no new electric generation plants have  been built in the state for 10 years. Last year, the state approved five  applications to build new plants, but they're years away from becoming  operational.       Under the deregulated market, electric utility companies were mandated to  sell their power generation plants. By separating the provider of electricity  and the generator of electricity, the idea is to usher in a more competitive  market. Today, San Diego Gas & Electric buys from electric generators through an  auction market. But the auction market rules as set up actually make the situation in San  Diego worse. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, when  electric utilities accept bids from generators at various prices, they are  required to pay to everyone the rate of the highest bid. But in a situation  where the electric company needs all the power available, it has to accept  all the bids and apply the highest price to every deal -- inflating the cost. Electric generators were taking advantage of the situation by charging more,  Sherry said. FERC is investigating and plans to issue a report later this  year. But for now, price caps have been set. Utility company buffeted Ed Van Herik, a Sempra spokesman, said the auction rules are putting the  squeeze on utility companies, already buffeted from all sides by public  outcry and political pressure. But Utility Reform Network's Finkelstein said San Diego Gas & Electric isn't  totally blameless because it could have done a better job of hedging high  costs. "They could have entered into (futures) contracts to hedge these risks,"  which would have allowed the utility to buy electricity at prices under  normal conditions, the attorney said.?
The following would be used only in response to media questions regarding  PG&E credit exposure.  Enron does not comment on specific credit exposures.  We are confident we  have established adequate reserves related to energy issues in California and  regardless of what happens there we are also confident we will meet our 2001  (recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.  (If pressed on the accuracy of the amount listed in PG&E's declaration)   There are lots of numbers being tossed around for all parties that are owed  money by PG&E.  All of them are subject to to modification as information is  corrected or updated.  The numbers in PG&E's initial filing were estimates  based on six month old PG&E data that may have been assembled very quickly.  (If pressed on the amount in the creditor committee letter)  Enron will not  comment on specific credit exposures.  We will not confirm or deny any such  numbers rumored to be in confidential correspondence.  Any number presented  would need to be further examined relative to collateral, reserves and other  credit offsets available under the circumstances.  Again, we are very  confident that no event related to this issue will prevent us from meeting  our 2001 (recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.  If we are asked if we filed to be on the creditor committee, I would confirm  that we did, and we are.  Mark
I met this morning with three officials from the US Consulate: Mitchell  Optican (Political and Economic Affairs Consul ), Patrick Santillo (Trade  Consul) and Peter Dykeman (Trade  Specialist).                                     They expressed the view  that, from their perspective, there was a very real risk that  restructuring  in Ontario will not proceed quickly  because of the political complications  coming out of California.  However, the Consulate has  also made a decision  to do what it  can to protect US commercial interests here -  the two  interests they identified were those of Enron and  Sithe.                                 They were  eager to explore  whether  there was an interim step or half way measure that would protect our  interests while allowing the government to play out the political agenda of  proceeding (and being seen to proceed) cautiously. I suggested that the only  such measure would be a scenario under which the IMO administered spot   market (including the market for wholesale industrials)  opened this November  and the retail market followed in the  Spring. There are arguments in favour  of this approach : greater confidence in IMO system readiness compared to the  distributor EBT/CIS systems; greater commitment of the IMO to market opening;  likely support from OPG  to this since it could secure access to NY and  proceed with FERC marketer authorization application;  it would enhance OPG's  announced divestiture program re 4000 MW;  and consumers/distributors could  be protected through a smoothed price plus a deferral account mechanism  pending full retail access.                                              I  explained OPG's position in NY where OPG had obtained a waiver of the NYISO  tariff's "reciprocity" provisions on the basis of Dave Goulding's assurances  in February 2001 that the market would open this year.  They understood and  agreed that it was easier and preferable for  the Consulate to raise with the  gov't the real potential that OPG's access may be lost unless the wholesale  market opens this year.                                 I have committed to  outlining a plan that focusses on wholesale market opening this Fall and  providing it to them next week.  The model will obviously have to be  consistent with the "four guiding principles" enunciated by the Premier and  Minister of Energy:  "protecting consumers and offering choice", creating a  strong business climate with a reliable supply of electricity", "protecting  the environment", and "encouraging new ways of doing business and supporting  the search for alternative sources of  power".                                                                         We are meeting again on Thursday to discuss with the Consul General  "Poncho" Huddle.   They are prepared to: a) get it included in Governor  Pataki's  statements when he meets with Harris at a NY/Ontario  economic  summit in Niagara Falls/Buffalo in late June, b) have the  new Ambassador  include it in an early speech in Toronto, and speak to the Premier and  others, and c) press the issue with their own contacts in Energy and Finance  in  Ontario.                                                                       Please give  me a call if you have any questions.  I will develop the model with input  from Paul and Garrett and Seabron Adamson/Kevin Wellenius.
Mark,  following our conversation, I will fax you consolidated feedback on Marcus  Von Bock. Could you send me your fax number. Is that number sufficiently  secure or should I call your assistant to let her know to collect it? Please  let me know how you want to deal with that.  Thanks    Mark

The attached document summarizes the main tasks I did in the last weeks.
Carol - I have reviewed the changes in both forms attached.  In the LOC, I  think that they are getting at the point to allow for partial drawings and  requesting to reduce the auto renewal notice clause to 30 days from 90 days.   Seems okay to me.  The proposed changes in the Letter of Credit Provisions,  please ignore.  I have discussed this with them and they have come off it.  Ed Sacks    [mailto:IMCEANOTES-moonevw+40selectenergy+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com]     Subject: Select Energy EEI and ISDA LOC Formats  Ed-  We received an email from your attorney about the LOC format for the two contracts.  Our legal counsel has reviewed the format and the provisions for the LOC and we have two proposed changes to the LOC format and one proposed change to the Letter of Credit Provisions.  Please call me to discuss these issues.    (See attached file: Enron LOC language EEI 052501.doc)   (See attached file: Enron ISDA LOC Format 052501.doc)  We would like to keep this process moving forward and finalize the contracts.  Thanks for your assistance.  Regards-  Valerie Mooney - Enron LOC language EEI 052501.doc - Enron ISDA LOC Format 052501.doc
Paul, You are correct...for us Core Procurement is just another customer. We keep records on all customers that us our storage program. The change was just to acknowledge that fact.

Dan--  I'm forwarding these comments to the Mortgage Agreement from Quantum for your  review.  I'm not very familiar with Mortgage/credit - type issues, but let's  discuss our responses at your convenience.  Thx  D  ---------------------- Forwarded by Dan J Bump/DEN/ECT on 01/25/2000 02:22 PM  ---------------------------  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.   12:43 PM    cc: "'roobannon@phillipsmcfall.com'" <roobannon@phillipsmcfall.com>  Subject: Bonepile:  WHGGS Mortgage     Dan, Per our discussion this am.  Mortage concerns: B. Recitals:  we want to make clear that the term loan amount can be "up to" $750,000 as opposed to "is" $750,000.  1.1:   Mortgagors need to be defined as all working interest owners in the leases and not the royalty or overriding royalty owners.  Also stipulate that ownership of the Wellhead Gas Gathering System (WHGGS) ownership is identical to the leasehold working interest ownership.  Here again Quantum will need to sign on behalf of itself and as agent for its program investors.  EOW will sign for itself.  The nonworking interest owners will also need to sign for themselves.  1.2.b:  Again stipulate that RI and ORRI owners not subject to mortgage or that all leasehold working interest owners are bound.  2.1:  Mortgagee would be the assignee in this provision.   We need clarification on the ramifications of the assignment being absolute.  2.4:  No duty of Mortgagee to produce rents is too much control to give Mortgagee even in theory.  3.1:  Stipulate that lien affects only leasehold working interest owners.  5.5.1:  Again mortgagor needs to be well defined.  5.1.(b):  Enernet of Wyoming (EOW) has granted a mortgage to secure the operations bond required by the Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments in the amount of $10,000. This mortgage is a permitted exception hereto. EOW has also file of record AAPL Model Form 610RS-1989 Recording Supplement to the JOA and Financing Statement in the ordinary course of business.  5.4:  The loss threshhold should probably need to be increased in light of the funding amount involved.  7.3:  The personal liability language referenced in this provision appears inconsistent with the in rem nature of the mortage and therefore out of place.   Dan, let me know when we can talk with you and/or your counsel on these matters.  Thanks, Doug

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.  The students and faculty members from the business school will be also  invited.  Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations  Research in particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets (S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).  My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also  have an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Dear Alicia,  I received your fax today for detail on PGE.  I need you to go through it and highlight the discrepancies and put them into DMS.    The systems that you have in place should allow you to identify the variances rather quickly.  Maybe Laura or Thresa could show you how to put them in the DMS system.  Please call me with any questions you have. I'll work on the DMS discrepancies as soon as I receive them.  Thanks,  Virginia (503) 464-8981

Brian, just so you know Transwestern's reaction, Pedersen's exhibit contains  factual inaccuracies we cannot live with (e.g., footnote 4).  If he wants to  file his own exhibit he is certainly free to do so.  We don't plan to offer  any comments to Norm regarding his exhibit at this time.    With regard to the exhibit you sent us yesterday, while Transwestern feels  there are many different ways to characterize delivery capacity to the  border, and we probably would have drafted the document differently, we would  support SoCal's filing of the exhibit with the Commission as it is currently  drafted for purposes of this proceeding.  Any questions or comments -- let me know. ---------------------- Forwarded by Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron on 06/16/2000  11:17 AM ---------------------------   "Norman A.

ALJ Biren specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit "should be narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity." Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to eliminate the column entitled "Total Take-away Capacity."  Furthermore, the column is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) and misleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in "S. Calif Take-away Capacity").  Also, you need to eliminate the "Avg. Daily Market" box.  The following is what should be submitted to ALJ Biren: (See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX.

Under the terms of the agreement, TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast  Pennsylvania. The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of 2001.  ANALYSIS: This is an interesting development, especially considering that TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from PECO Energy. This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain. On the other hand, it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company, founded earlier this year by Enron (along with partners AOL and IBM).  As you may recall, just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached an agreement with PECO Energy to supply "competitive default service" for approximately 300,000 of PECO's residential electricity customers who have not selected a competitive energy service provider. Green Mountain formally challenged this agreement, arguing that the PECO/TNPC agreement is "not in the public interest" and that Green Mountain should have been awarded the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question. Thus, it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of wind power to its portfolio of services. Up to this point, TNPC has been working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers, such as the approximately 285,000 natural gas and 20,000 electricity customers it purchased from Columbia Energy Group. The acquisition of the customers in PECO's territory was a major coup for TNPC, which is still in start-up mode. Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from PECO, the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity as a provider of renewable energy.  Community Energy, the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power that it will market, began making wind power available to businesses in Pennsylvania last year. TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy in fixed kilowatt-hours, allowing for more customized service and tailored use of power. Interestingly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about 37,500 MW of green power to aggregated state agencies. This indicates that desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania, and any energy provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green power in its portfolio. Thus, while renewable energy was not a fundamental component of TNPC's original business plan, the company appears to be moving in this direction (at least in states where it is strategic to do so).  However, this announcement comes on the heels of TNPC's announcement of its third-quarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price. TNPC's revenues for 3Q 2000 were $18.2 million, derived from the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states  (Pennsylvania and New Jersey). Gross profit was $1.3 million, or 7.2 percent of revenues. Yet, the loss on earnings before income tax (EBIT) was $68.3 million. The net loss for the quarter was $69.9 million, or $2.96 per basic share. TNPC reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history. Therefore, the company contends that its year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful or indicative of future performance. The company's goal for 4Q 2000 is to achieve revenues of approximately $60 to $63 million, with an estimated year-end customer count of 340,000.  Eugene Lockhart, TNPC's CEO, said he was pleased with the 3Q performance. Lockhart contends that TNPC "achieved both our overall financial performance targets and business objectives," and referenced the fact that the company is still building its "systems and architecture" so that it can continue to penetrate additional competitive markets. In addition, TNPC has raised approximately $546 million in funding which the company is using primarily to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation.  However, despite its positive outlook, after TNPC made its earnings  announcement its shares took a nosedive, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy provider's ability to meet its objectives. The shares closed last Friday at $9, which is a dramatic drop from the average price of $25 before the 3Q earnings announcement. TNPC issued its IPO on Oct. 5, 2000, at a price of $21 per share, which at the time seemed quite high for a start-up energy company with a limited track record. A day after its opening, the stock closed at $27 per share. The stock was received so favorably for two reasons, in my estimation. First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate, private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-up capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority owner of TNPC, with 57-percent control. Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base of over 325,000 customers.  Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock, and the company is at a crossroads. In order to keep its momentum on track, TNPC needs to do two things. First, it needs to acquire additional customers to expand its base. Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best  opportunity to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace in those states. Second, as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov. 6, 2000, energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors. Consequently, it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that it will be a provider of wind power. This could potentially send the stock price on a upward climb again, despite the fact that financial success of the company is still unproven.  Regarding the customer base expansion, Ohio looks like the next state that TNPC will target. Just last week, the company filed an application with the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state. Yet, it's clear that TNPC is still fine-tuning its marketing approach. In Ohio, it is offering customers competitive energy prices, flexible payment and pricing choices, and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive, but there is no mention in TNPC's application that it will provide renewable energy in Ohio.  Moreover, several questions remain. Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role for itself as a renewable energy provider, or it just providing wind power in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state? Will the addition of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC? Will TNPC  demonstrate revenues of $63 million in 4Q 2000? And where will the company's next  acquisition of customers take place? All of these questions directly impact the future success of TNPC.==============================================================  Miss last week?

Joe,  We really need you to put your deal tickets in sitara on a timely manner.  I just looked at unify, and there are no deals in for the month of March.  Please get with Chance or whomever you deal with in risk to ensure this is happening.  Thanks, Kim  Kim Olinger Manager Gas Logistics 713-853-7504
Clarissa, what did you find out about me receiving different volumes at Boston than what I requested.  We are penalized for over or under deliveries to that pool.  We are now in "critical day" status, which means that we are charged 5 times the daily index, which is GDA plus some other charges. It is very important that I receive exactly the volume requested.  Please talk with the shipper and ask that they adjust the volume each day as requested.  I know that these are small voumes, but we have to play by the rules.  Day 1, requested 75, received 82 Day 2, requested 97, received 100 day 3, requested 87   For the weekend, I have changes only going to the Boston meter.     - Enron Supply - TGP.xls

Here is the scoop:  Date:	Thursday Dec. 13th 8pm  Where:  Galveston, The Opera House.   I know it won't be a fun drive home but the show is not coming to Houston this year.  Ticket Price: $36 or less.  We are getting the 36 tickets as I want good seats on the first level.  However, we may not all be able to sit together.  I thought it would be fun to leave Houston a little early on Thursday, say by 430ish and drive to Galveston for dinner somewhere and then go to the play.  Let me know if you are interested in going, I plan on getting our tickets by tomorrow.  Jennifer
Great--Texans know the difference between a dog and a bird.  Still unclear  whether they recognize the distinction between a hen and a hun!!!  (Read  John's email more carefully!)  Of course, at Pheasant Haven you can shoot  both (and probably the dogs too) so the difference doesn't matter.  Kevin,  I've been thinking about your original reqeust and may need to exercise the  Legal Dept. veto.  These customers of yours are the same ones that can't  drive a jet ski without paramedics around, right?  And now you want them  wandering around Nebraska heavily armed???  What the hell are you thinking?

Besides, when I hunted there last, we  couldn't shoot hens.  PS-- I have my personal duck lease down here that we can also make  available.  There are overnight quarters if we need them.

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've  taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT  good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not  too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a  force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm  right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the  charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager  to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance  Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My  condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .  Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie  co-workers through this trying time.  Susan  (Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or  so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are  an "Ag" man now.)

Enron can turn energy usage flexibility into revenue for our customers. When a customer chooses Enron's product,  they receive monthly payments in exchange for reducing their energy usage at Enron's request. Requests are made  when energy market prices are high, so the energy the customer doesn't use can be sold on the market at a premium.  Bad time for the customer? No problem--they can choose not to reduce usage, and pay a  "buy through price" to Enron instead. Want to learn more? Click here .

This is the David's answer:  The only one that I can think of that may be of use is the "CES Volume Comparison" report ... that is the one that ya'll had for January that showed all of the purchases and sales, by pipeline.  It is available for any month. The reports that I regularly used were for helping to clean up current month activity, which would not be of any use to you.

George-  In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the  referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well  piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing  approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may  want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month.  Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently  show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King  Ranch.    Thanks.

Hello Mark,  Both Bob and myself have left messages to speak with you about email  retention time.  Those messages must have been lost, so I have decided to try  email.  The group we work in, Technical Power Services,  is project oriented.  We are  an extension of the Engineering department.  As you are well aware the  development, and construction of power projects can be a minimum of 9 months,  to as long as 4 years plus.  To give an example, the work that has been  started on the coal initiative. At $4-$5 mmbtu for gas, the development of  coal plants becomes more economical.  This development is just starting,  nothing will be decided for a couple of years, then if it goes ahead  construction could easily be 3 years or more.  What we are trying to stress is the information that is started in the  beginning of a project needs flow through to the end of the project, which in  most instances is longer than a year.  Some of the current power projects we are developing have COD date in 2002 to  2004.  The retention of email is important to the projects.  The companies that we deal with will be keeping the correspondence and if we  don't have our own copies, I think you know where this is going.  We would like to discuss this with you.  There has been folders set up in the  Public mailbox system to give us more than the 100MB limit.  This is very  helpful since some drawings files we receive can be over 10MB.  We are patiently waiting to speak with you on this subject.  Thank you.  Terri Austin Development Engineer 713-345-4681

Jeff, thanks for your work on Bob's draft, however, for form management  purposes we are going to continue with our previous style which is to include  the crossborder annexes.   1.  Attached below is the ENA/US Annex A, which is the base GTC type of  document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA  in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ENA contracts  with a Canadian party we use the Canadian Annex attachment (also attached  below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ENA contracts with a foreign  counterparty other than Canada, the Canadian Annex may be utilized with  additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for  this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach  rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US.     2.  Attached below is the ECC/Canadian Annex A, which is the base GTC type of  document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA  in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ECC contracts  with a US party we use the United States Annex attachment (also attached  below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ECC contracts with a foreign  counterparty other than US, the United States Annex may be utilized with  additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for  this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach  rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US.     At your convenience, please review the Canadian and United States annexes and  advise of any comments.  Thanks again.  Note to Paralegals:  Please note that the annexes are now under current  forms.  If you have any questions about how they are to be utilized, please  stop by to discuss.

The memo distributed on June 27 on Reimbursement of Individually Billed Items  requires clarification.  The intent of the memo was to give employees an alternate  method of paying for pagers, cell phones, etc.  Employees can continue to submit  these invoices to Accounts Payable for processing or  pay these items with their  corporate American Express card and request reimbursement through an expense report.   Either way is an acceptable way to process these small dollar high volume invoices.

Subject:	Portland Real time address list  Serena & Lisa,  I have not been getting the EPE pre-schedules.  I think there is more than one address group out there for real time.  The correct group is as follows;  DL-UBSWEnergyRealPortlandRealTime  Thanks A-Lot!
I appreciate the succinct summary and lead time and we will get our thoughts  to you on Friday.----cgy    Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron  Subject: Forward Index Position  We potentially have a huge exposure associated with forward index sales in  California.  If the FERC implements a "soft cap" then the index that they  post will not exceed this "soft cap" even if the PX (for PX markets) or the  ISO (for the ex post market) buys a material quantity of energy above the  "soft cap" price.  The FERC is likely to implement either a $100 or $150  "soft cap."  Let's say the FERC implements a $100 "soft cap."  It is likely  that there would be 20,000 MW of demand at that price and perhaps 5,000 MW of  supply (I made these numbers up).  I am not sure how the PX would allocate  its scarce supply -- a logical way would be pro rata which means that each  buyer would be awarded 25% of its bid.  So let's say we were short 100 MW of  index and went to buy it back from the PX each day.  We would have to submit  bids for 400 MW in hopes of getting 100 MW.  Eventually buyers would bid for  many multiples of their load, driving demand up while supply remains fixed  thus lowering the percentage that each buyer receives.  To fix this problem,  the PX could limit the amount that you could bid for in their market based on  how much load you serve.  EES might argue that they can bid since it is their  load.  Long story short -- their are lots of ways for this to explode into a  big problem for us and only a few ways for things to turn out fine.  Here's what I'd like to do.  First, I would like to get a download of all  Index Forward deals currently on the books for delivery starting in January  of 2001.  I want to see all important deal attributes in a spreadsheet.  I  think that the result of this process will be that we are short up to a  couple of hundred MW of index power in California over the next two years.   Bob Badeer will lead that effort.  Then, I need to understand what our legal  position is with respect to the FERC, ISO, and PX redefining the index.  Do  our contracts give us an out if the index materially changes in a way so that  it no longer reflects a competitive market clearing price where supply and  demand balance?  Christian Yoder should be the point person on that effort.   Thanks for your help on this matter.  I will be out of the office on  Wednesday, Thursday, and most of Friday.  I would like some answers to this,  to the extent that anwers are knowable on the legal side, by Friday.

Also attached is the Enron Gty you wanted me to e-mail you.  I've made the other three typo changes you mentioned and am running off final documents for execution.  I will fed ex them to you this evening after obtaining signatures on this end.  Susan and I spoke this morning and after you receive the fed ex package and turn them over to her, she and I will proceed from there. We both have copies of our checklist.  Thanks - Maria           Subject: FINAL Comments     Adele and Maria: Here are my final comments:  1.   In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes effective?  2.   In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.  3.   In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.  4.   In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs to UCP.  That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your opinion shortly.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    - enronga.doc - p8.doc

As I  investigated this further, it appears the SoCalGas Reservation Charge was  changed as of 6/1/00.  Did you notice this?  I don't think I saw the changes  reflected on the most recent Savings Analysis spreadsheet.  I have attached  the 8/2000 Commercial Industrial Rate Schedules Summary.  Can you please give some feedback?  I want to know how this should be  figured.  The last rate was based upon November's usage, divided by # of  days.    Thanks,  Denise

I have NOT been able to assimilate and insert the press materials I got from Jeff this morning.  I will be back from a commissioner meeting at noon California time and can assist in further editing at that time.  I do believe that some of the press material can be helpful.  Please send comments back by email.  I can be reached by cell phone for part of the time during the next 90 minutes.  Mike Day  cell 415-279-0702  - X26059.DOC
There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips.  O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.    There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files.   We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that.   I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.   KK
Pursuant to our discussions this morning, attached is John Griffith's file  regarding the changes in extrinsic value for each of the transport books.  As  we discussed, each of you should make a determination as to what changes in  correlation you should make to offset the decreases in value due to the  change in the model.  Since you have been using the correlation factor to  adjust the values to reflect market, a simple change decreasing these  correlations will offset the change in value due to John's "fix".  This  change simply makes the transport model one step closer to properly  reflecting the intra- and inter-month optionality values--Research did review  the change and agrees that it is appropriate.  If you have any questions,  please call me at x35514.  John, thanks for your help with this!  Greg, please coordinate with the traders when you expect to make this change  official in the books so that they can change their correlations accordingly.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT on 12/21/2000  11:28 AM ---------------------------   John Griffith@ENRON 12/21/2000 10:20 AM  cc: Greg Couch/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ed McMichael/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Moon/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Transport  Colleen,  Attached is a spreadsheet with 3 sheets - 1 with the 12/19 value, 1 with the  changed value and 1 with the difference.  Call me with any questions.  I am  working on explaining why a couple of deals went up in value.  Thanks.  John

__label__5 All,  We have seen some symptoms of problems with the voicemail system.  The Problem: The Message Waiting Indicator (MWT) on the Meridian phones is not lighting for several hours after new messages are received.  What we are doing about it: I have contacted PGE Telephone Services and they have opened a trouble ticket to have the problem looked into.  The workaround: If you are expecting messages or if you have not checked your messages in a while because you have not seen the MWT light, please proactively check your voicemail box by dialing x7600, hit the # key for you mailbox, and enter your password.  I will send out an update message when I have more news.  Regards   Dave Steiner Enron Net Works, LLC  Office - (503)464-3701 Cell - (503)703-1553

__label__1 Everyone,  Looking for a volunteer to market TW to this new power plant so that they will take the supplies off our pipe.  Any takers?  Kim.      Subject:	RE: New Mexico Power Plant Project  Supplies have not been lined up as of yet.  They are waiting to get farther along on the permits.  TK      Subject:	FW: New Mexico Power Plant Project  TK, just checking to see if you have heard who may be supplying the supply for this plant?  Thanks, Kim.      Subject:	FW: New Mexico Power Plant Project  Can we contact them to find out about how they plan to get their gas supply? I know Stan will ask me about this one.      Subject:	New Mexico Power Plant Project  Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant  Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM.  Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million.  Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing.  Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers.  MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."  Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."  The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration.  Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

__label__13 Attached are the spreadsheets for September and October.  There is a measurement issue on 9/27.  Finalized TW measurement at the Interconnect shows 39455 Mmbtus, whereas SCADA from Gas Control at the inlet to the plant shows a volume of 58411 Mmbtus, therefore creating a difference of 19949 between the interconnect and the inlet to the plant.  Craig, I don't know if you have a more accurate number or if we just want to go with the 39455 measured volume since I believe it to be the most accurate volume.  Please respond with your feedback on this issue.    Thank you! Amy Mulligan

Thanks Ken D.
__label__11 Rick,  With the recent burst of the Internet and communications bubble in the public  equity markets, I wanted to send you an email describing our position,  exposure and ongoing strategy.  Our aggressive use of accounting management  vehicles, and early sales of positions has significantly reduced our  accounting volatility and economic exposure.  Hopefully, the following points  will address the appropriate issues.  Currently we have invested $108 million in 22 companies.  Of that,  approximately $80 million still has accounting exposure.  The other $28  million invested has either been hedged or already written down.  Our  disciplined use of Fair Value accounting has allowed us to minimize  accounting risk by not writing up investments simply because of improving  market conditions. Specifically - Avici, Sycamore, and FastForward have generated approximately  $180 million in earnings this year.  DEN, Salus Media, and IAM.com have  combined for $9 million in writeoffs. Recently, I have done a review of our portfolio and I believe our accounting  loss exposure for 2001 is limited.  Over 80% of our portfolio companies have  raised enough capital to sustain them through all of 2001.  So, if the  markets (private and public) are closed, I do not believe these companies  will risk bankruptcy during 2001.  Also, our discipline of only co-investing  with big partners helps assure these companies will continue to get funding.  Going forward, we are making certain revisions to our strategy to take  compensate for, and take advantage of, the weak markets. Limiting venture investments to technology companies that we have a  competitive advantage in assessing the technology risk.  Also, moving our  venture effort earlier stage to take more technology risk and less market  risk. We are beginning to look at other types of private equity investments.  There  are many public companies, whose stock prices are at 10% or less of their  highs.  I still believe that the fundamentals of the industries indicate that  the vast majority of these companies will go bankrupt.  However, there will  be a select few that will survive and will end up with reduced competition  and big markets.  These companies will be big winners.  We are carefully  looking for these.  I will keep you informed as this develops.  If you have any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks,  Kevin Garland

__label__1 From http://www.enerfax.com:  ANR Cuts HIOS Volumes; Mainline Work Planned  ANR Pipeline says volumes from the High Island Offshore System and West Cameron near shore blocks have been reduced by 40 MMcf per day due to compression outages at Grand Chenier. The reduction began Wednesday and will remain in place until further notice. ANR is also planning to perform pipeline maintenance on its Southeast Mainline beginning June 4th and continuing through July 6th. The work will reduce capacity by 195 MMcf per day from June 4th  10th, 225 MMcf per day June 11th  12th, and by 60 MMcf per day June 13th  24th. June 25th  26th, capacity will be reduced by 140 MMcf per day and by 220 MMcf  per day from June 27th to July 3rd. The work will cut capacity by 25 MMcf per day from July 4th  6th. ANR's system consists of 10,600 miles of pipeline and 74 compressor stations with a design peak capacity of about 6.6 Bcf per day.

I will nominate tentative date for April and May  which we can revise next month. As an  indication I will nominate the 1-5  April followed by another cargo 35-40 days later. These dates are consistent  with the current planned outage and a dispatch rate of between 76% and 85%.  If anybody has and any questions or comments please let me know.  TP

His current status is day to day.  James Stewart <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1116&>, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/29/01 Stewart was inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at RB for the Lions.     Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/28/01Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1265&>Emmitt Smith <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit." But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.   Daunte Culpepper <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=133263&>, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.!   Eddie Kennison <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1790&>, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1253&>, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink! ?s! cript=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1204&>, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1843&>, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1072&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=133393&>, WR BUF -! D! Rock's Beaatchs Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=187382&>, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Update! d ! 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 10/28/0! 1 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Righ! t,! now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the match! up! dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.  Cowboys <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.

__label__1 Is someone from our group working on this? ----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 08/01/2000 01:14 PM -----  Tracy Ngo 08/01/2000 07:48 AM   cc:  Subject: assignment of deals from Merchant Energy Group of the Americas to  Morgan Stanley  Tana,  Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the  assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who  previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and  with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is  working on this.  I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all  questions to Mark.  Could you let me know if you have any info?  Thx, Tracyh
__label__7 I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.  I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are coming  from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.    Kay     "Campbell, Carolyn" <CCampbell@KSLAW.com> on 04/30/2001 10:02:44 AM  cc:    Subject: Delta Documents   Kay:  Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80% interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to hold in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in possession of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with another client most of the afternoon today).     There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for the retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts on this?  Carolyn M.

__label__1 Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her  number is 703-853-3001.  I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own  curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her  group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15,  SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to  include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty.  While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations,  she said.   I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our  real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in  Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until  that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of  petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check  that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More  information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.  Kate
__label__14 Hello, Everyone -  This Notice confirms our next RTO West Regional Representatives Group (RRG) meeting for Friday, June 1.  The meeting will be held at our usual place - the Portland Sheraton Airport Hotel, Columbian Rooms, from 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.  The working agenda for the meeting is:  1.      Congestion Management  The Congestion Management work groups have performed indefatigably in developing a consensus model that we envision will be the basis for the very substantial amount of congestion management work that lies immediately ahead. The model will be presented by Kristi and Barney for full RRG discussion as the first agenda item.  2.      Stage 2 Filing Plan and Schedule  We're still putting the plan and schedule together for your review.   We appreciate the helpful comments on scheduling that many of you gave us at our May 4 RRG meeting. We've tried to accommodate your views as much as we could.  Here are the assumptions that are guiding the Stage 2 Filing Plan and Schedule:  a.      There will be an August 31 interim filing and a December 1  completion filing.  b.      The August 31 filing will include information about key  components of RTO West, such as the congestion management model, an "illustrative" pricing model, planning/expansion principles, and lists of facilities for inclusion.  c.      Work will continue to be sequenced. For example, after  essential congestion management work is completed, work on losses, and ancillary services will commence as soon as possible.  This sequencing will require a major effort on congestion management with tight deadlines over the next five weeks.  Work on all items needed for a completion filing in December will commence as determined appropriate.  d.      Work on underlying RTO liability issues will continue in  parallel throughout the near-term schedule.  We'll have a fuller plan and schedule for your review on June 1.  3.      Report on RTO West Technical Conference with FERC on Liability  We will give you a report on the RTO West technical conference that is being held today at FERC on liability.  As you know, in the April 26 RTO West order, the Commission rejected the entire liability program.  An objective of the technical conference is to explain the filing utilities' concerns about risk allocation and liability and try to find an approach that can resolve these concerns.  4.      Benefit Cost Analysis  As we previewed at our May 4 RRG meeting, we have initiated  discussions with some potential contractors who could assist in developing a new RTO West benefit-cost analysis.  We will report to you on the status of those discussions and the next steps to move ahead on this important issue.  This Notice is being sent to you via our new "exploder" system, so I hope it goes only to those who have told us they want to receive it. Please do not reply to this e-mail as your reply will go to the entire RRG list of 400+ folks. We've already annoyed enough of you as it is.  Thanks very much, and we look forward to seeing you on June 1.  - Bud

__label__11 Please respond to SBX2 78 (Polanco), the MOU opposed by SCE, failed passage in the Senate Energy Committee.  The bill will be voted on again in committee tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.  If the bill succeeds, it will immediately go to Appropriations and then the Senate floor.  ABX2 82 (Keeley/Hertzberg), the MOU supported by the Administration, passed out of the Assembly Energy Committee and the Assembly Appropriations Committee, largely on a party-line vote.  The first time the bill was voted on by the Energy Committee it failed passage.  On reconsideration Rod Wright and Dead Florez switched their votes and the bill passed.  The bill will be heard on the Assembly floor tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.  ABX2 50 (Wright, Campbell, etc.), the MOU minus transmission, passed out of the Assembly Energy Committee, largely on a party-line vote.  The bill will be heard by the Appropriations Committee tomorrow upon call of the chair.  SBX2 18 (Burton), DRC, will be heard by the Senate Energy Committee tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.  It is my understanding that the Republicans may be supportive of this measure which requires a 2/3 vote.

How it works  All NETeller.com account holders will be emailed a 5 or 6 digit Secure ID.   This Secure ID will be unique to each individual NETeller.com account holder.  Your new Secure ID is: 885892  The Secure ID will be changed and updated approximately every 4 months and  this change will be emailed to all account holders at that time.  Upon successfully entering the users Account ID and Password, each user will  be prompted for their Secure ID code.  By entering the Secure ID, users will  gain access to their account page.  If you forget or lose your Secure ID code  you may contact our customer service department at 888 258 5859 to retrieve  it.   NOTE REGARDING PASSWORDS  You will NEVER be asked to reveal your NETeller.com password by a  NETeller.com representitive. You should NEVER give your password out to any unauthorized user. Passwords should be changed regularly and often.  Thank you  The NETeller.com Development Team
__label__1 Cara, Corry,  Here is a consolidation of your input:  Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data. Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records.   The path should resemble:  UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data.  Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.  Add an option to clear the sheet to start over. The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records. Add "Prepare Next Day" and "Copy Workspace" functionality. Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color). Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  A simple search for string or number will do. Daily Summary needs to be completed. Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation. Fix "General SQL error.  ORA-02289: sequence does not exist" problem. "insert keys" etc to tool bar.  (example: redo, insert row,...)  Although the sheets in this app are similar to Excel, there are some limitations.  Implementing things like "redo" can be complicated if not impossible.   When you open "path confirmation" it defaults to your last user sort settings.  I don't know if this is possible.   Very Important: We need to determine what is the very least requirements for this application to replace your current processes.  The goal of this application is to allow you to set your excel worksheets aside and work strictly within Pre-Schedule Workspace (PSW).  If with the current approach we are not able to achieve this goal, we need to take a step back are reevaluate our situation.  Also, I can provide some of the basic Excel functionality that is currently missing, but I don't want to get into a situation where I am rewriting Excel.  We need to determine what Excel functionality is a must and what functionality we can do without.  Let me know if you have any other concerns.  Thanks, Will

__label__1 Tanya,  Some stability tests were performed on the simulation. (1) The Window size of the averaging in the simulation was changed from 10 to  20 for NG-PRICE(the biggest book in gas) for effective date June-28 .  As you  can see in the file 28NG-Price_Windowsize, the Component VaR numbers are very  similar.   (2)  To look at a calculational comparison, I looked at the STORAGE-PRC book  (which has no gamma position) for effective date of 27th and (a) calculated  FFVols, and (b)calculated the RiskMetrics VaR (the correlations are very high  across the term structure) and compared to the Component Var code  calculation, and again the two nubers are comparable, given the different  modes of calculation.

__label__13 Mark, Back In January approximately Visualpro was updated a new file was created  called old errstat.db we also have about 20 turbines off-line at Trent Mesa  due to leaning towers. It could be that it has been off-line since the  update. I am also attaching a updated channel list for Visualpro High speed  running number is still not explained to my satisfaction but, it is  definitely not Tip Speed the numbers are to small. Let me know if their is  any further clarification you would like on this list.  Regards, Paul Landers       Mark Fisher 04/08/2002 12:51 PM  cc: Hollis Kimbrough/EWC/Enron@ENRON   Subject: WR527 Pitch System Faults  Paul,  Here is the formatted pitch system fault information you requested for the  Trent site. I have several comments. (1) The data came from the March 20 Trent data download. (2) 6 turbines did not have the ErrStat file included in the download. These  are denoted by blank cells in the fault columns in the attached spreadsheet. (3) While looking through the data, I noticed that there was at least one  ErrStat file that was downloaded and showed no recorded status messages. I  checked the corresponding ErrDev file and there were status messages being  recorded there. I have sent this information to Germany to see if there is an  explanation. (4) Turbine 99 is represented in SCADA at Trent by 199.  If you have any questions let me know. I will probably do one of the other  smaller sites before checking into tackling Clear Sky.

__label__8 I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.  After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.  Ken Lay

Sorry for the goof.  This document was revised to make Enron a signatory in order to comply with the confirmation notice, but the legal effect of Enron's signature is really no more than an acknowledgment since its liability allocation deal vis-a-vis each of the seller and transporter is set out in the Master SPA and charterparty.

The meeting will take place  in EB 4746.  We will forward specific materials to you in advance of the meeting for your  review.  It is our objective to obtain your sign-off regarding the selected  agreements.  In the event that there are significant issues remaining, we  would like to chart the appropriate course of action -- i.e., either pursue  negotiation with individual ILECs or opt-in and seek specific amendments.    We would like to begin at 1pm.  Please reserve the duration of the afternoon  as we have several states' agreements to review.  Also, I would appreciate it  if you would RSVP.  Thanks.

__label__9 As you probably know by now, Enron recently entered into a new relationship with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group to manage and administer its temporary staffing program. This new arrangement is designed to improve service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's temporary employment needs. There are many benefits, including a web-based application which will provide Enron's temporary staffing users with online ordering, approval and reporting. More details on this system will be coming soon.  In order to help the Managed Services Group serve you better in the days ahead, please take a moment now to fill out the profile questions below and forward your reply to Joseph Marsh at Joseph Marsh/NA/Enron. This information will not be used for solicitation, but rather to facilitate a more efficient ordering process.  Name: Business Unit: Department: Phone / e-Mail: Cost Center: Number of Temporaries currently in use: Average / Peak number of Temporaries used per week: Skill sets / Positions required:  Phase I of the program, which starts January 2, 2001,  encompasses all administrative/clerical temporary employees in the Houston area.  Please note that we anticipate no changes for temporary employees currently on assignment at Enron as we make this transition.  Again, more details on the Managed Services program and processes will be distributed in the coming weeks.  As of January 2, the Managed Services account team will be on-site to answer any questions and handle your temporary employee needs.  They will be available via e-mail or by calling 713-345-6899.

__label__6 TOP 10 WAYS TO BE THE FUNNIEST GUY IN YOUR OFFICE  10. Keep telling the same person they have bad breath even if they don't, and then punch them in the face.  9. Announce in a meeting that you have AIDS. After everyone gives you the sympathy remarks, tell everyone you were kidding and call them a bunch of queers.  8. Before a meeting, fill your mouth with custard. In the meeting pretend you're hocking up a loogie, spit it into a glass and hand it to the person next to you and say "BEAT THAT!"  7. Inform a male co-worker that he would make a good hooker, then piss in his coffee and tell him he needs a good ass fucking.  6. Always walk around with a big smile and keep one hand down the front of your pants.  5. Answer every question with " Fucked if I know...", then call the person a racial slur that doesn't even match their race  4. Brag about the fact that you carry a gun, and keep playing with your nuts. Get them really sweaty and go around shaking everyone's hand.  3. Run down the hall with your dick out spraying piss everywhere yelling "It wont stop! God help me it wont stop!" Then when it does, look down and say, "Oh! I must have broke it."  2. Ask to borrow a co-worker's expensive pen- Bring it to the bathroom and stick it up your ass- return it to the person and tell them that it smells bad and tell them to smell it- when they say that it smells, say "It should - - I had it up my ass!"  1. Shit on your office floor and when someone comes in and sees it tell them it's the fake rubber kind. When they try to pick it up and realize that their hand is full of real shit - - laugh and embarrass him in front of everyone.

__label__8 At Enron, we=01,re good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing   products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers  =01)  the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot bett er  is watching our expenses.  We=01,re all shareholders in this company, and w e  need to spend our company=01,s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.   There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make   sure we=01,re careful with Enron=01,s money.  The Policy Committee has appr oved and  recommended the following:   ? Professional Services =01) This is our largest area of discretionary spen ding,  at more than $600 million last year. =01&Professional Services=018 includes our  contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other  consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and   terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring al l  future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be  negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS),   effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be  pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and  GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.   ? On-line expense reporting tool XMS =01) XMS, our online expense reporting   tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July  1,  all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for  reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to  http://xms.enron.com/.    ? Enterprise wide portal =01) We currently have 122 internal web sites acro ss  the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and othe r  related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.    It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access conte nt  and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easie r  for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new  company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched i n  several phases beginning this fall.    Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is   travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As   we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating   those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advanta ge  of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and  booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company   without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are   common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling fo r  business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations   will be reviewed by each business unit leader.   ? Air travel =01) Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in th e  Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location -   all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by   GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking  service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same  negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book   non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than  refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.    For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase  non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.   ? Lodging =01) GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel   chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit=01,s  individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron=01,s list of pref erred  hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit=01 ,s  policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.   ? Car rental services =01) When renting a car for business travel, employee s  should use our preferred car rental agencies =01) National (U.S. and Canada ) and  Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to prote ct  you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit  http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outsi de  the U.S.   ? Off-site meetings =01) All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events wit h  more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate   preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.   Because there are differences between business units and offices, each  business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further   elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.   Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron   retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensib le  actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look fo r  cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If   you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please  e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions   and answers about these policies is posted on  http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional  questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on  Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving  recommendations.

The new service will  include the unloading of LNG from tankers, LNG storage, vaporization, and  delivery of natural gas to points along Cove Point's existing pipeline.     Cove Point LNG is offering 750,000 dekatherms per day of deliverability and  4.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of vapor equivalent storage capacity initially.  The service includes a proposed expansion of the available storage capacity  to 6.75 Bcf approximately one year after the start-up of the LNG receiving  operations. Pending approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,  Cove Point LNG plans to begin the LNG tanker discharging service by late  2001.   Located in Lusby, Md., the Cove Point LNG terminal includes liquefied natural  gas storage and terminal operations, and an 87-mile natural gas pipeline that  connects with gas pipelines in Northern Virginia. The terminal has installed  send-out capacity of 1 Bcf of gas per day. With the proposed storage  expansion, total LNG storage at Cove Point will be 7.5 Bcf of vapor  equivalent natural gas. The Cove Point LNG terminal currently provides "peak  shaving" services to customers in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions.    Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading  energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its  operating companies engage in virtually all phases of the natural gas  business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and  distribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum  product sales, and electric power generation. Information about Columbia  Energy Group (NYSE: CG) is available on the Internet at  www.columbiaenergygroup.com.     This press release contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning  of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning, on a  consolidated, segment or subsidiary basis, Columbia's plans, objectives and  expected performance. There can be no assurance that actual results will not  differ materially due to various factors, many of which are beyond the  control of Columbia, including, but not limited to, the regulatory approval  process, competition, weather, supply and demand for natural gas, and changes  in general economic conditions.   /CONTACT:  Media: Michael J.

__label__13 FYI      Subject: RE: Midcoast    Thanks Jason,  How long has this request been in Clements hands, that group has a tendency to have a slow response time.  Is there no other way we can proceed with execution of the document while we wait on the Guaranty?  Also, Midcoast has been transacting at the parent level (Midcoast Energy Resources) and these trades will need to be assigned to Midcoast Marketing under the new ISDA.  I think it would be a good idea to prepare assignment documents as well to have the trades moved. Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

__label__1 The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  today and tomorrow  .    There are three worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the citygate delivery points indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.  The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the requested daily citygate volume relative to a prior value.  For the  current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the  previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is  3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.  The sheet labelled storage is for tracking our TCO storage injections (paper injections).             Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317  - 04-06-00 daily volsAM.xls

__label__7 201 Situation:  Powell Goldstein called to clarify what the situation is after several  misleading trade press articles indicated that the Administration was leaning  against filing a Section 201 initiation.   The Bottom Line is:  the  Administration is still very much undecided on how to proceed on a 201  investigation and even more undecided on which remedy to implement if harm is  found.   We have learned from Senior level officials they are considering the  following options:  Option 1: The Administration will initiate a Section 201 investigation on  steel with an accompanying statement saying that the initiation does not in  anyway indicate if and what remedy would be implemented.  The threat to an  Administration investigation, is that quotas are the expected remedy.  By  taking this approach, the Administration would allow the ITC to determine if  the imports are trade related or a result of industry market structure, while  placing a chilling effect on the possible implementation of quotas.   The  USTR supports this approach; the Department of Treasury has not been persuade  it is prudent; the  Department of Commerce is trying to negotiate the middle  ground; and the White House is still undecided.  Option 2:  Allow the Senate Finance Committee to initiate a 201  investigation, but issue a similar statement indicating no remedy  commitment.    Timing:   The EU-US Summit is meeting the second week of June and this will be on the  agenda, so do not expect anything before June 14.  The Senate Finance  Committee is in transition after Sen. Jeffords switched parties and the  Committees are being reformulated, which could take several weeks.  Look to  the end of June for a decision by the Administration.  The Administration  will face pressure to make a decision after the Steel Workers converge on  Washington next week.    Remedy:  There has been some confusion about a Multilateral Steel Agreement (MSA)  being negotiated in place of a 201 investigation.  We have learned that this  is not going to happen.  The MSA is one of the possible remedies, but the  Administration has made it clear that it would only be a possible remedy if a  Sec. 201 investigation is initiated.  An MSA would require voluntary  restraints negotiated between all steel producing nations.  Another option  are voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) which are bilaterally negotiated  agreements.   The other options are well known:  quotas, tariffs,  quantitative restrictions, etc.

__label__13 CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  CES is selling 2500  dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.  Looks like a match to me.  I told Fred  with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below.  For future  reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295.  A backup contact at Equitable is  Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.  Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective  12/1/99.  On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal  141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.  I don't see a sale anywhere to  FirstEnergy.    Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.   I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.

The traditional Marine Corps mark of respect was rendered to the new president.

__label__7 Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage   To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.    The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

Press Release   OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR  PR01: 285 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 06/10/2001     GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE   Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans   LOS ANGELES   Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes  the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary,  emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large  businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power  emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating  customers.   "Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial," Governor  Davis said. "Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even  avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources  to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they  voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods."  The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent  load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent  System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned  Utilities.   The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer  2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be  determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the  amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated  to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of  customers who sign up.

__label__9 Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate  the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the  systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups  necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market  opportunities.  With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk  groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing,  structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and  back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these  services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice  President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the  Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will  continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice  President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the  Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim  Belden.  These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while  ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading  organizations.  These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don  on their new roles.   John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen

Sharp, and  she understands that he wants to explore opportunities at EWS (I'm learning  the new nomenclature).  John Schwartzenburg understands this as well.  I can recommend Carlos as a solid, intelligent, hard working lawyer. He's a  great guy and I believe he would fit in well here.  Thanks,  Kay ---------------------- Forwarded by Kay Mann/Corp/Enron on 11/20/2000 10:17  AM ---------------------------   cc:    Subject: Opportunities at ENA  Kay, as we've discussed before, I'm interested in pursuing the opportunities  available in the ENA legal group.  As you know, my experience at EECC in  addition to focusing on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture  agreements, has also included cross-border financing agreements and merger  and acquisition activity.  Before coming to Enron as you recall, I worked  with a New york based firm here in Houston where I focused mostly on  transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions  involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's  electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly,  I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in DC where I focused on  general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business  entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and  securities offerings.  Thanks for your help.

__label__1 Rick Causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called  iBuyit.  One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts  payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices.   As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and ? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus ? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or  approved; and ? view an electronic image of the actual invoice  These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce  the time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also  begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information  currently in use.    This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP  processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.  This transition  is expected to be completed by August 2001.  You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and  training opportunities in the coming weeks.  Please contact your AP  representative if you have any questions.
__label__9 It is just an exciting time to be taking macroeconomics...  I) Be sure to follow the rise in interest rates in UK, ECB, and US.  We will be discussing the pros & cons of each region's rise.  Try to decide if the ECB or the FT editorials (today pp. 12 & 13) are correct on the need for the ECB rate increase.  II) You might also glance at articles on falling real estate prices in Japan (p. 4), and the article on Daewoo's bankruptcy (p. 12).  III) Yesterday's FT had a long editorial on markets for the inputs into global warming (Thurs. 11/4, p. 14).  What are the pros and cons of markets for controlling externalities of this global sort?  IV) Hint: A typical set of exam questions might be... Consider one of the following nations that have had special sections in the FT this term: Ireland, Brazil or Ghana. 1. What is are 1 or 2 of the most serious threats to short-run growth in GDP for this nation? 2. What short-run fiscal or monetary policies are appropriate? 3. What is are 1 or 2 of the most serious threats to short-run growth in GDP for this nation? 4. What longer-term policies are appropriate?  These are just the sections of this week, and I do not promise to give a large selection of nations (although I will give > 1 unless I choose Japan, Russia, or the EC).  David I.

__label__1 As most of you know, we have signed a Memorandum Of Understanding with  Equilon on this project.  Joe Richards will call a "kick-off" meeting on this  deal for next Wednesday, and at that time, we will begin dividing up due  diligence assignments and areas of responsibility.  In my view, we will learn  a lot in the first two or three weeks of due diligence about our ultimate  chances for closing this transaction.  Three big areas we will need to get a  handle on are: (1) The dollar magnitude of the environmental responsibilities  we would be taking on; (2) The quality/condition of Equilon's real property  (ROW) records; and (3) Any major commercial/business/contractual issues  surrounding this deal.  "Disclosure" is an important concept in this process.  If the deal moves  forward and we become more confident of closure, we will, at some point, have  to make some sort of announcement to the public about this transaction.  We  DON'T want to do this now, or any time in the near future, because the deal  is too uncertain/tentative at this particular juncture and we do not to say  anything that could prove misleading.  Equilon has sent out a verbal notice to their field supervisors that they are  in exclusive talks with a potential buyer (us).  At our request, they have  not identified EOTT as the potential purchaser.  If they were to identify us  at this point, and if word were to get out "on the street" about this pending  deal, we might be forced into making some sort of premature disclosure, and  we don't want that.  Accordingly, it is imperative that we all keep as quiet  about this deal as possible (for now) and that we not discuss it in any  shape/form/fashion with anyone outside of our company (other than our  lawyers), or with anyone inside of EOTT who does not "need to know."  In  particular, we have to make a concerted effort to make sure that "our" field  people don't start talking with" their" field people about this deal.  There is always some degree of leakage in these matters, but we must do our  best to minimize it----so we will not have to disclose this deal until we are  ready. Please advise if there are any questions, and please share these  thoughts, as and when appropriate, with the appropriate people within your  respective groups.  Thanks.  SWD

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel Taub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray  Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity  market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a  misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was  intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve  Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press  list, he said.  Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would  compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a  state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and  confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is  buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a  meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail  contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of  electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough  electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged  from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the  e-mail is accurate.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a  megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to  Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot  market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher  than on the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a  quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each  season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law  requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

__label__1 Agave Energy - Agave purchased a seasonal winter transport agreement for  7,000 MMBtu/d on the Atoka lateral through May 2001.  This effectively sells  out the Atoka and actually bumped some gas Duke/GPM had been delivering to  the pools for free.  Incremental revenue for this deal is $70,200.  EOG Resources - The new EOG well on the West Texas lateral has been connected  to TW but we are waiting for them to install an EFM device before we allow  the gas to flow.  Burlington Resources - The letter agreement amending the interconnect and  operating contract for the Burlington Val Verde plant on the San Juan lateral  was sent this week.  We will adjust the prior period and remaining 2000  invoices once the contract is signed.  PNM Capacity - FERC issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in  the PNM capacity docket.  We had asked for rehearing of the order limiting  TW's acquisition of capacity to summer-only months.  There is no deadline for  the Commission to act on our request so we'll have to wait to see when it  appears on the docket.  PG&E - Representatives visited TW's offices this week to discuss a number of  things including western gas flows, storage, winter and summer peaking  capability, and EDI interface possibilities.  In response to TW's request,  Rod Boschee indicated they may increase their capacity to take TW gas from  300,000 up to 400,000 MMBtu/d!!  They would like to implement this change  before Thanksgiving (in time for bid week) but are waiting on some upper  management approvals first.  To date, they have been very pleased with the  efforts of TW personnel to clean up the various substances contaminating the  PG&E line.

__label__2 The ISO Market Surveillance Committee recently filed a report at FERC where it estimated the excess profits earned by in-state generators and importers as a direct result of individual exercise of market power.  They came up with a number of approximately $500 million.  They then quantified the impact that this had on the rest of the market and came up with a number of around $6 billion.  They used codes to identify individual market participants.  The media has now received the matching of code names to company names.  The Oregonian picked up an LA Times - Washington Post Service article yesterday highlighting the excess profits earned by PowerEx, BPA, and LADWP.  Enron Energy Services is rumored to be on this list.  I have no idea why.  I thought I'd give you guys a heads up in case media calls start coming in.  Alan Comnes (503-464-8129) is probably the best source if you want more facts on this.

__label__10 Spotlight Report Exchange products seeing slow trading GAVIN SOUTER  03/20/2000 Business Insurance Page 3 Copyright (C) 2000 Crain Communications, Inc. All rights reserved.  Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have been somewhat slow to get off the ground.  Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a significant volume of trades.  Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains abundant and relatively cheap.  As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will remain limited, observers say.  Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one contract against another.  Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director, capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in New York.  The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that hedge, he said.  Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp. stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane explained.  The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop indexes, Mr. Lane said. "For the insurance buyer, such exchange instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a good surrogate," he said.  The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.  The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.  "The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not looking for other ways of doing business," he said.  At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success since they were introduced in the 1970s. "There is a belief that alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to predict when," Mr. Mooney said.  Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.  Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off, however, and was suspended last year after two years of little activity.  The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.  Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker at the CBOT who trades in options.  No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were traded, Mr. Purty said.  "I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they really take off," he said.  The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative coverage options, Mr. Purty said.  The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney, chief operating officer.  CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks and to build balanced portfolios.  But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney said.  Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr. Sweeney said.  Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a "cash for cover" exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry loss over an agreed threshold.  Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them form groups whose members do business only with one another.  Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades, totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits, he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers, insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their captives, Mr. Sweeney said.  "We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied with what we have achieved so far," Mr. Sweeney said.  The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last year.  Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather derivatives .  Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.  Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a resultant fall in revenues.  The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas, Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering contracts based on cold weather.  Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.  In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.     Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Joe  /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/  Hi Folks,  Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your lineups for the stretch run.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week.  PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players.  Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks. Let's get to it.  /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense.   Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Minnesota Defense  Stacey Mack played well last week rushing for 115 yards on 28 carries (4.1 ypc).   He's settling into the starting RB role pretty well.   Still very quiet on the Fred Taylor front so you have to assume Mack's going to keep his job.   With no playoff hopes, it probably makes sense not to rush Taylor back.   Mack will face an ultra soft Viking defense this week ranked # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Indianapolis Defense  Curtis Martin ran hard last week.   He had 78 yards on 24 carries (3.2 ypc) plus he caught a couple of passes.   This might be his week though as the Colts are weak on defense ranking # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If he's going to explode, this is the week.   St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Carolina Defense  Start Faulk.   End of story.   He's the best player in Fantasy Football. If it matters (and it doesn't) the Panthers rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Faulk's knee was described as "puffy" after the game but he insists he'll be fine and play.   Although some are saying Trung Canidate will see increased time.   He's still a must start in my opinion though.   Tennessee's Eddie George / Skip Hicks vs Oakland Defense  This one hurts.   Eddie George owners have been circling on their calendars the Oakland game with their porous rush defense.   And then Skip Hicks comes in last week and looks like Earl Campbell rushing for 142 yards on 17 carries (8.4 ypc) and a score   (Granted, those numbers are padded with a 51 yard rush)   George is such a team player that he reportedly didn't mind Hicks staying in the game as he had the hot hand.   I think you'll see George back this week in his regular role but Hicks could get the call at any time.   The Raiders have improved on defense.   Now they just rank # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense.   Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Bob Christian vs Buffalo Defense  Maurice looked a little better (or healthier) this week but he's still underperforming.   He rushed 11 times for 49 yards (4.5 ypc) Sunday.   Bob Christian is clearly going to be more involved at RB.   He had 7 rushes for 17 yards (2.4 ypc) and a score.   Christian also tacked on 66 yards receiving.   At this point, I'd say Christian deserves a look in larger leagues.   The Bill Defense is pretty weak ranking # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Washington Defense  With 31 carries last week for 173 yards (5.6 ypc), I think it's safe to say Thomas is back.   He's a perfect fit for this conservative offense.   Plus the Bear's defense looks like it'll keep them in most games which keeps Thomas involved.   He'll face a Redskin defense that ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Cleveland Defense  It's my opinion that Ahman Green owners should just forget about last week. Green was held to just 9 yards on 9 carries by a surging Tennessee defense. I see very little to make me think this wasn't an aberration.   This week, he'll face a softer Brown defense that's ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, Cleveland is ranked # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Fantasy Football owners traditionally have memories that last about 7 days.   I personally am not letting last weeks performance wipe out what has been a great year.   Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs New York Jets Defense  It's too early to be talking about Edgerrin James being a product of the "system" but the truth of the matter is that no name Dominic Rhodes is tearing it up lately.   He's had 298 rushing yards over the last 3 games. Sunday, he rolled for 177 of them on 29 carries (6.1 ypc)   (and his longest run was 35 yards so it's not like he padded the stats with a 80 yarder)   He caught 3 passes to boot.   Clearly, he's playing at a high level right now and is a must start in most leagues.   The Jets were horrible early on against the run but have now improved to average ranking # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   New England's Antowain Smith vs Miami Defense  You know Antowain Smith had fun against his old team Sunday when he rolled up 95 yards on 20 carries (4.8 ypc)   He continues to be one of the better stories of 2001.   Over the last 3 weeks, he ranks as the # 8 RB in Fantasy points per game.   Smith should have had a TD but went down at the 2.   This week, he'll face a Dolphin Defense that's been soft lately.   They rank # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   New Orleans' Ricky Williams / Deuce McAllister vs Tampa Bay Defense  Williams had a sub par game Monday night and it does seem like Coach Jim Haslett has been looking the other way the last few games.   He only had 14 carries Monday.   He did gain 57 yards (4.1 ypc) so he did well when he was in there.   Some of that can be attributed to the Rams and their offense taking Williams out.   Although you can't ignore Deuce McAllister. McAllister had 5 catches for 44 yards (but just one carry)   The Bucs are nothing special lately ranking # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Keep an eye on Tampa's Warren Sapp who missed a good bit of time last week with a shoulder injury.   It'd be a nice boost if he's less than 100%.   New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Seattle Defense  Barber continues to steal the show from Ron Dayne.   Barber rushed 16 times for 85 yards (5.3 ypc)   Dayne only had 4 carries for 9 yards.   Barber was also the Giant's leading receiver with 5 receptions.   I don't see that changing a lot.   Seattle is ranked # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs Philadelphia Defense  Garrison Hearst continues to be one of the best stories in the league.   He ran for 103 yards on 26 carries Sunday (4.0 ypc)   You have to be a little worried about him though as Kevan Barlow got both rushing TDs.   And both Terry Jackson and Fred Beasley saw red zone carries.   Hearst will be a guy who runs up and down the field but it looks like coach Steve Mariucci has more faith in the other guys for the goalline.   The Eagles rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way   Arizona's Michael Pittman / Thomas Jones vs Dallas Defense  Things are looking pretty bad for Michael Pittman owners.   As we commented earlier, the carries allotted to Jones have been creeping up.   Last week, it looked more like a full blown time share with Pittman running 14 times for 37 yards (2.6 ypc) and Jones totaling 24 yards on 12 carries (2.0 ypc) Clearly, neither are any good but that's bad news for Pittman owners.   Of even more concern is the fact that Jones is looking like the short yardage / red zone guy.   The Cowboys rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   It's tough right now to put much faith in either guy though, even with the favorable matchup.   Buffalo's Shawn Bryson vs Atlanta Defense  Travis Henry's tough rookie year continued Sunday as he injured his knee. Shawn Bryson will likely get the bulk of the work this week.   Bryson didn't do much Sunday running 14 times for 38 yards (2.7 ypc)   He did catch 3 passes.   He'll likely be better with a week of practice with the first unit.   The Falcons haven't been anything special against the run lately ranking # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year.   Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense  Emmitt Smith looked like the "old" Emmitt Smith.  "Old" as in 2001 version which means not very good.   He struggled to get 39 yards on 12 carries (3.2 ypc) and generally wasn't a factor.   He's an up and down player so realize your taking a chance with him.   The Cardinals aren't much on defense ranking # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Miami's Lamar Smith vs New England Defense  Lamar Smith is a grinder type back that needs lots of carries to be effective.   He only rushed 9 times Sunday for 22 yards (2.4 ypc)   That won't get it done.   Travis Minor is a threat but it looks to me like the Dolphins will stay with Smith for now.   New England ranks # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis / Amos Zereoue vs Detroit Defense  Amos Zereoue had a pretty good game against Baltimore with 73 yards on 16 carries (4.6 ypc)   But he hurt his shoulder and is now questionable for this week's game.   Fuamatu-Ma'afala ran hard but had little room to move gaining 15 yards on 9 carries (1.7 ypc)   And finally, Jerome Bettis is in the mix although the early word has him as doubtful again for this week's game.   Obviously, they're being very careful to preserve him for the playoffs.   We'll try to stay on this story this week for you.   The Lions are surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Kansas City Defense  Tomlinson struggled a bit last week with just 46 yards on 17 carries (2.7 ypc)   He did add 23 yards on 6 catches.   He'll face an improved KC defense this week ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs New York Giants Defense  It's been an up and down last couple of weeks for Alexander owners but with Ricky Watters broken ankle, Alexander is back in the saddle as the # 1 Guy. Look for him to pick up where he left off.   Last week, he rushed for 27 yards on 7 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a TD.   The Giants have been pretty average lately in stopping the run ranking # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Washington's Stephen Davis vs Chicago Defense  Stephen Davis played well last week with 111 yards on 24 carries (4.6 ypc) He was one of the few bright spots for Washington.   This week, he faces a tough but beatable Bear defense that ranks # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense.   Baltimore's Moe Williams / Terry Allen vs Cincinnati Defense  You know it's not good when Obafemi Ayanbadejo leads the team in rushing yards and Elvis Grbac leads the team in rushing TDs.   But that's what happened Sunday against the Steelers.  ( I wonder if Ray Lewis thinks the Steelers have a "real defense" yet?)   Moe Williams logged 15 yards on 4 carries (3.8 ypc) and Terry Allen made a less than smashing debut with 3 yards on 3 carries (you do the math)   Tough to say how it'll be split this week but you'd have to think Allen will see more time.   The Bengals aren't as good as Pittsburgh, but they're very good ranking # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tough matchup especially since it's not yet clear how the carries will be split.  Cleveland's James Jackson / Jamel White vs Green Bay Defense  Watch this one closely this week as Jackson tweaked his troublesome ankle again.   He could be ok, but it's not clear early this week.   If he can't go, I'd expect you'll see Jamel White over Ben Gay as Gay has made more than his share of mistakes.   Whoever runs will be facing the suddenly vulnerable Packers who rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs San Diego Defense  We had Holmes ranked # 5 last week.  I'm guessing you'll see more sites follow our lead and raise him up the charts as well.   He had a monster game (again) with 121 yards on 29 carries (4.2 ypc) plus the score.   He's a must start against pretty much any defense.   This week, he'll face a San Diego team ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Still though, I wouldn't let that stop me.   Do keep an eye on his health this week as he's nursing a sore groin that might limit him.   Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Jacksonville Defense  Outside of Indianapolis, I don't know that there's been a more disappointing than Minnesota.   Or one tougher to predict each week.   You get fired up on Michael Bennett and then he cools off.   Last week, he was back to his early season workload with only 10 carries.   He did gain 40 yards (4.0 ypc) so when he ran, he did fine.   With him, it's a numbers game.   Give him enough carries and eventually he'll break one.   But 10 opportunities won't do it. And he'll face a very tough Jacksonville defense that's been hot lately. They rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Oakland's Charlie Garner vs Tennessee Defense  Charlie Garner had his usual productive day with 68 yards rushing on 19 carries (3.6 ypc) plus another 45 yards receiving.   The big news was Tyrone Wheatley not getting a carry.   Looks like Zack Crockett is back in at the goalline.   Although that can change at any moment.   The Titans shut down Ahman Green last week so that's a worry.   They rank # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs San Francisco Defense  Staley continues to salvage his rushing numbers with his contributions in the passing game.   He rushed 15 times for 36 yards Sunday (2.4 ypc)   He also had 2 fumbles.   But on the bright side, he caught 8 passes for 73 yards.   They'll find the going a little tougher this week against San Francisco ranked # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs New Orleans Defense  You'll go crazy trying to figure out which one of these guys will do anything week to week.   Dunn only had 10 carries for 27 yards (2.7 ypc) and Alstott only managed 7 rushes for 23 yards (3.3 ypc)   Dunn was heavily involved in the Tampa Dink and Dunk passing game but that's tough to count on.   They'll face a New Orleans defense that's likely smarting from the Rams defeat.   They rank # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.     /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense.   Carolina's Richard Huntley vs St. Louis Defense  Huntley should be rested after the bye week.   Unfortunately, rest won't make him any more talented.   The Rams rank # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this isn't looking good.   Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Baltimore Defense  It's strength against strength this week with Dillon facing the Ravens.   If you can imagine it, the Bengals will be hurting without Akili Smith at QB... That means Dillon is the whole offense and you can bet the Ravens will be geared up for it.   On a forward looking note, it doesn't get any easier for Dillon as he has Tennessee and Pittsburgh on the horizon.   If your trade deadline hasn't passed, I'd consider dealing him.   The Ravens rank # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but I think they're better than that.   They rank # 3 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Detroit's James Stewart vs Pittsburgh Defense  James Stewart's hip injury may not be as bad as feared.   He had a solid game in their first victory last week rushing for 91 yards on 20 carries (4.6 ypc)   The awful news this week is that he's playing Pittsburgh.   The Steelers are dominating offenses right now ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.    /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

__label__13 Hey guys,  I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.  Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us.   And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).    Happy New Year!  Carrie

__label__1 Gary,  Below is some information that might be of assistance to you.  I don't think  that I sent this to you when I got it.  If I did please ignore this.  D'Arcy  Carroll (works for us in S. America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot  of people there.  He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally  for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.  On a  recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good  opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.  Coffee, Orange  Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.  D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.  Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.  A  phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.  He  knows a lot about Cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets.  Mike ---------------------- Forwarded by Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT on 07/12/2000  11:32 AM ---------------------------   D'Arcy Carroll@ENRON 06/09/2000 02:30 PM  cc: Steve Nagy/SA/Enron@Enron, Joe Kishkill/SA/Enron@Enron  Subject:   Mike,  please find attatched 2 resumes, as mentioned.   1. Rob Tesar.  Position: Enron Networks, Agricultural Markets.  Rob Tesar is  American and has worked for 15 years at Cargill, the first 10 or so inside  the  grains businesses where he managed the central hedging desk out of  headquarters.   He is a class act; if he has any weakness it would be a  tendency to  be too cautious.   He is significantly underutilized in his  present position.  2. Detlev Hartman.  Position: open.  Detlev is German and was my boss at DG  BANK in Frankfurt, in the early stages of the development of the finanical   derivatives markets in Germany in the late 80's.  His professional background  is diverse with a pretty consistent emphasis on finance.   Detlev is one of  the  brightest, intuitive minds I've ever worked with; he could contribute in  the MG initiative or in any number of trading, risk management oversight  positions.   Somewhat volatile personality, but exciting to work with.  Daudi Lelijveld.  Position: Enron Networks, MG or logistics.  Daudi is a  dutchman with a broad background; he has run Cargill's UK metals business for  the last 5 years, or so.  He is putting his resume together and I'll forward.   Paul Lichter and Mike Walden.  Position: IT - I have forwarded information to  Jahn Pavetto.

__label__11 Renee, Wow!  I was so happy to get your email.  Congrats.  You guys make a cute  couple.  I'll try to attend, it is on the calendar. mike
__label__12 Greetings All:   First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i s  very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this   morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.   Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f or  delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:   I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would   be appreciated.  As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on  Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to "wallpaper" Sacramento wi th  our proposed legislation.  This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the "final" version s  of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I  believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.  You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver  to  his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on  Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed   legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.  When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would  determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same   time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will   handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom   you've decided to circulate.  This email does, however, include a "summary" of our proposed legislation.    But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the  appropriate language to distribute "to the world," or if we'll need instead   to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a "one  pager" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the   package effectively.  We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our  proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul d  propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the   Direct Access coalition?  We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the  PR  machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our  legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we   can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted   Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.  You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR   credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.   You note that attached to the email is a "legislative fix" to AB1X that cou ld  solve the credit issue and an attached set of "taking points" related to a   second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying tha t  DWR will get its money for power purchase costs.  Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to   get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a  brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section  (legislative solution) under the topic "create a real competitive retail  market in California."  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have  legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to  discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.    If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please   don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.  I can be best  reached to day by pager at 888.916.7184.    Thanks to all for helping pull this together.

Based on our conversation,   this email includes the following:   An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan ds.   Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow  to remove those impediments.   A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability to  sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two  possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC  order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through  rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I   have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d  amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable   option.   Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.   Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-   and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your  office tomorrow detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will   also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our  proposed language.   I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m e  if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi ng  else that I can do to assist you.   Regards,  Ken     Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes   in Installing Small-scale Generation on Tribal Lands   David Parquet, Vice-President  Enron North America  101 California Street, Suite 1950  San Francisco, CA 94111  Phone: 415.782.7820  Fax: 415.782.7851    2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation   Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges   Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a  step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been  designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract  monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t he  elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than  1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for   California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e  the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by  offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o f  distributed generation.    Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with  investor-owned and municipal utilities   Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is  a  step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete  interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this   requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed  generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when   interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome   through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent  possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th e  utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be  accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.   Permitting and Air Quality Issues  Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs or  greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d  therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale  generation faces.    Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru   D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant   output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil ities.  In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to   face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial  interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects .   These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.   3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase   Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities   Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with   suppliers.  Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e  goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.  However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk   concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.  We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c redit  risk concerns.  Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and   is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to   both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements   going forward.   Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue   Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority  The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to  charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our   analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the  California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.   As  such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es  adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.   Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018  The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public   Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are   =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref use to  allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power  purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee  to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that   DWR has entered into with suppliers.    Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to   Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases  In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority   noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to   the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl oy to  permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i s  extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re  DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it  is  difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in   rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase   costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since   suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover   from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.   Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk   We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk  issues.  We have identified three options:   Amend AB1X  The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the   PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur red by  DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary  to  ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the   preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political   challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file  entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)   Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and  through Contract Language  This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to  implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re  time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic   copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC   would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,  =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)   Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk  As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac cept  other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,   cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have   indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR   prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through   contract amendments.   4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001   Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research  Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports   showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe r  only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al l  credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer   of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are  likely.    CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this  summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our  estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well  below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio n  in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power   than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the  unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o  date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t he  flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply.   California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to  this  requirement.    Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early   draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve re  supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced   number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the  utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t  pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be   added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.   CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of   rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more  optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000   MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California   should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.   5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California =01,s  Electricity Crisis   This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil l  deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing   bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.   As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's  crisis must focus on four issues:   Increase supply  Decrease demand  Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market  Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency   Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)  To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years.    Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less   than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.   The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi slation  are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho se  efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face   in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit  requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s   proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)  transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an  innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund  emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a ir  districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the  required reductions in pollution emissions.   Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)  Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing   the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the   best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo st  effectively and quickly in two ways:   Buy-down demand  California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d  to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand more  economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld  be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,   through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to  determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To  participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment  necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the  reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D eal  Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.   Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment  To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:   An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price   for hour-ahead power in real time.  Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment   verification.  Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be   paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).   The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e:   =01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti cularly  in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation   resources.  reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California  electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity  in  the state.  fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k  of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to  customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for   responding.   We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in   excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for   summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate   that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time s  that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates  directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and  control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.   Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi cle:  SB27X  The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re  customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy   service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from   customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th e  prohibition against Direct Access.   Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a   direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o f  Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from   customer migration.    In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when   the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme nt  is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial  condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should  therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement  function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a  non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ ia  should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period  in  which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments   of utility load.   Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative  vehicle:  AB18X  Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand .   In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand  imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers   and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia  State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend ed  period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e  in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to  participate in that market.   California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a   series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate  increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without   =01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c ould  amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio d.   In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:   First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in  recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of  AB  1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r eceived  from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e  accrued due to the retail price cap.

KMR has controlling  interest in three natural gas-fired power plants having a total capacity  of approximately 600 MW.  AES will be acquiring two of the three natural  gas-fired power plants located in Cartagena  through a 100% interest in  the 314 MW TermoCandelaria power plant and a 62% interest in the 90 MW  Mamonal plant.   ANALYSIS: AES continues its "non-strategy" of acquisitions in the purchase  of KMR. In a recent interview with Dennis Bakke, AES CEO, I asked him sever al  times about AES "strategic plans," to which he answered, "We don't have  (one)."  Ideas often flow from the bottom up in the mega-power company  due to its decentralized structure.  Decisions are made in response to  a unique company mission which is "to serve the world and steward its  resources,  making clean, safe, reliable electricity available."   So why venture into Colombia, a hotbed of political and social upheaval  with an uncertain business environment? A risky business by many energy  companies' standards.  But AES has created a dramatic international network  guided not essentially by the almighty dollar, according to Bakke. "We'll  go anywhere we are needed, or wanted, and can live our values and principle s."   So, given its unique company policies and experience in South and Central  America, KMR is a prime target. AES is perhaps the most suited to successfu lly  penetrate the dictatorial climate of Colombia and spark a change as they  do what they do best =01* buy, command and redirect electric service from  that monopoly into a clean, reliable and democratically supported power  service.   AES has made headlines throughout the year 2000 with its continuing list  of acquisitions and development in countries including Chile, Bolivia,  Argentina, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, England, Tanzania, Venezuela,  Puerto Rico, Brazil, Bulgaria, Republic of Georgia, and most recently,  Oman.   The acquisition of the Venezuelan utility C.A. La Electricidad de Caracas  (EDC) captured the headlines for several months earlier this year. AES  was involved in what was billed as a "hostile takeover," in a process that  intrigued the energy community.   AES purchased approximately 35,529,500 American Depository Shares (ADSs)  - including ADS's subject to guaranteed deliveries, representing approximat ely  49% of the outstanding shares. Dennis W. Bakke commended the Comision Nacio nal  de Valores, the Venezuelan Securities and Exchange Commission, on its final  action to allow AES to extend its offer after several stressful attempts  to close the deal.  But Bakke said the action would send a strong positive  signal for foreign investment in Venezuela.   "We were hoping to serve that country and we thought we could do a lot  better job than was being done by EDC. We didn't give a second thought  about controversy. We knew this was the right thing to do."   Bakke maintains that Venezuela has been run by a handful of very wealthy  and powerful families for many years. AES has the clout, the money and  the mission to go in, shake things up and, in line with AES' goals,  "to  create a stronger economy, a more competitive society." The strategy in  Colombia appears to continue that focus in South America.   "We've made a lot of changes (in the company) and it's not only going to  change Venezuela, but I think it will make a big difference in the neighbor ing  states as well."   Bakke is irrepressibly enthusiastic about the AES mission, although admitti ng  that maintaining its lofty principles is a challenge.   "(Our position and principles) seem to always be under attack," said Bakke.  "I know of no other corporation in the world of any significance that sees  its role in the world the way we do. But, our purpose has grown over the  years and actually deepened as we've expanded further and further into  the world."   AES has had another winning year. A world leader in generation, its value  has doubled in the past year,  Generating assets include one hundred and  twenty-five facilities totaling over 44,000 MW of capacity world wide.    Can it continue balancing the tightrope of economic growth and philanthropi c  philosophy? So far, AES seems to have been "touched by an angel" in its  endeavors into areas where "others fear to tread."

__label__2 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.  Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.

IN THE NEWS  Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday.  In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year.  "We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

__label__7 Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power  to the state, a U.S. court rules. By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton BEE STAFF WRITERS (Published April 6, 2001)  In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a  federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order  that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state  without guarantee of payment.  State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but  could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant  off-line for maintenance.  On March 21, citing "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California  landscape," U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction  against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators.  Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20  percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found  that loss of that production "poses an imminent threat."  But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown "a high  likelihood of success on the merits" of its appeal.  While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the  question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel  directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in  July.  The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least  temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which  maintains and controls power transmissions.  It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any  of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers.  "It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change  anything over the weekend," said Detmers. "But if Reliant decided on a  unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely  could have a system emergency."  Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but  declined to specify their next move.  "Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California," said company  lobbyist Marty Wilson, and "is still of a mind to want to cooperate."  Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District  Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co.,  alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and  production of electricity.  The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of  interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales  into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order,  and that goes directly to an appellate court.  The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two  other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though  the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly  in debt.  Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay  their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to  the utilities.  The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston  and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing &  Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue  supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to  sell to companies that are not creditworthy.  But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can  rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice.  "My hope is this is a temporary setback," said Robinson. He added, however,  that the practical effect is "at least for now, we don't have a tool to  compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do" -- respond to  emergency demands for power.  Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no  jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators  and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must  settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs.  In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special  expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO.  "Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court  agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper," he  said. "But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short  supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at  risk."  Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for  the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend  the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its  view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has  jurisdiction.  Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday.  In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for  energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big  utilities and sell its power on the open market.  Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants  that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in  Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell  its power to PG&E.  The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative  energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell  their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state.

We did experience a technical problem on Tuesday and most of you received files from both the 17th & the 18th.  This problem has been addressed and we do not expect it to occur again.  However, I do want to provide you with some information to help each of you understand the number of files that you are getting as well as the data contained in each.     Attached is a spreadsheet that has been put together to document the various payment proposals that are run for each business unit, what company codes are contained in each and who the proposals are being directed to.    The first column on the worksheet titled "Approval List" documents the BU Proposal category.  For each BU the companies have been divided into Dip & Non-Dip as applicable.  This was necessary because the vendor selection criteria for each group is different and we did not want you to have to look at the Pre-petition Dip open items on a daily basis.    The second column contains the SAP proposal names.  The importance of this column is that it documents the type of information contained in each run.  Company status (Dip/Non-dip), Business unit, & type of payment.  The following is a legend on how to read the proposal name.   5-character group name (ABBBC) A - Denotes Dip company BBB - Business unit identifier C - Type of payment job (E - Emergency check, C - Check/ACH, W - Wire transfer)  4-character group name (BBBC) BBB - Business unit identifier C - Type of Payment job  (E - Emergency check, C - Check/ACH, W - Wire transfer)  NOTE:  Not all companies have the ability to send payments via all methods.  Some companies may only be able to do 1 or 2.  The second worksheet in this file "Template list" contains a list of the company codes contained in each template.  This file does not list all company codes configured in SAP only those that have payment capabilities.    The desired result of this process is to document the items contained in the file that you DO NOT want to be pay.  (The assumption on a going forward basis is that we would be paying most of the items contained in the files.)  Please denote these items by putting "Do not pay" in the first empty column to the right of the data provided.  Once you have reviewed each file, please save it and forward on to George Wasaff.  George will then take this information to the cash committee for approval.  When the Cash Committee completes their review, George will communicate back to the ISC the information, and we will execute the proposal for payment.    I know that this is a very manual process and we are currently working with Andrew Parsons and others to automate, simplify and adjust the deadlines.  We will be communicating changes as they become available.          Subject:     This is the spreadsheet with the approval list and template names.   Tammy   <<PROPOSAL TEMPLATES.xls>>

__label__7 Republican Plan B A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal: ? Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is  that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and  too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.) ? The Republicans will "suggest" that generators take a 30% haircut.  "We  think this is doable." ? The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets. ? Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would  establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by  the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants. ? Resolve the QFs' financial issues.  Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to  work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel  "frozen out."  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an  option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.  Democratic Plan B A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B: ? The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's  MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly  has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still  being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.   Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is  reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this  may be unnecessary. ? The details of the plan are reportedly as follows: - Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a  dedicated rate  component. - The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of  their  claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated  through a  dispute. - This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to  strike a deal  for PG&E. ? Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in  cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following: - The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell  of pieces of  the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a  lifetime stipulation on  how they will be run. - Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as  $5 billion if  it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the  bankrutpcy judge to quell  the protests against such a plan that would very  likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly  believe that the Judge Montali would  support this idea.

My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests,  Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've made a few small changes: Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea.  The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.  Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it is a turkey.  We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them.  They are lying. We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.  We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.   In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table.  In a separate room.  Next door.  Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.  I stress "private", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances, enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.  I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that "passing the rolls" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance.  Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it.   Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably won't come next year either.    I am thankful.

__label__6 Two things: First. What does the art of motorcycle riding have to do with  lost literature or George Eliot? Second. Elliot is spelled Eliot. But  otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable e-mail message, if not a tad smug over the  whole book-finding issue. Where did you find it, anyway? E-bay? Afghanistan?  You know, in some circles they would consider procurement of that book akin  to scoring a pound of pure cocaine. Not that yucky not adulterated stuff. I'm  rambling and should actually go do some work, being that that is the  technical term for what I'm doing right now. "Working," that is. But I have  several spreadsheets strategically placed around my computer screens (I have  two, that's how important I am), to make it appear that I'm VERY, VERY busy.  And speaking of importance, I'm curious to know if you're the actual "owner"  of the Portland Running Co., as it states on your card, or if the Portland  Running Co. is one of those forward-thinking organizations that gives all its  employees pseudo-ownership in the form of one stock share, or if those are  just cards you had made to impress people? In any case, I probably owe you  some retroactive respect for your ingenuity, either for becoming the owner of  such a shop, or for making people believe you are. Hey, do you know what  George Eliot's real first name is? If you respond to this e-mail in the next  twenty minutes, I'll tell you. Otherwise you're on your own. By the way,  that's a beautifully worded passage you chose. And it rhymes, in case you  didn't notice that.

__label__3 All,  As many of you already know, I decided to take a position at EES, so this week suppose to be my last week in the Gas Fundamentals Group. It is a pretty satisfactory feeling to the reporting team and myself that we are able to contribute to the success of gas trading by providing over 100 reports every day. I certainly appreciated all your help, cooperation and friendship. Needless to say it was a great experience to work with  you all.   At Dave Dronet's request I'll stay one more week to transit my responsibilities to Kim Alexsander next week. Kim will lead the reporting team and continue provide the excellent support to you all. The reporting team is in good hands. Even after I move to another group, I am just a phone call away, I'll let you know my new phone # and continue to help you wherever I can.   Thanks....

Tony will try to complete these transactions as ENA (or enovate, if necessary).    Richard

__label__7 In order to standardize confidentiality agreements within the Power Group, at  Elizabeth's request, please use the following forms.  1.  Unilateral Confidentiality Agreement - Counterparty Protected. (Form  location:  Power Forms Database)  (To be used prior to commencing a trading  relationship when EPMI needs to evaluate the prospective CP's financial, load  or other similar information.  Thereafter, the confidentiality provisions in  the Master and, if applicable,  the Confirmation, should protect  Transaction-specific data. )  2.  Unilateral Confidentiality Agreement - Enron Protected.  (Form location:   Attorney Forms Database, Document No. 1100.2).  (To be used when only EPMI is  supplying confidential information.  Note:  This is the standard Finance  Group Form and needs to be tailored first, i.e. by changing the Enron  entity's name to "EPMI", by defining the "Transaction", etc...)  3.  Bilateral Confidentiality Agreement.  (Form Location:  Attorney Forms  Database, Document No. 1100.3) (To be used when  two-way confidentiality  protection is required.  Again note that because this is a standard Finance  Group Form, it must be similarly tailored.  It also contains an optional  Chinese Wall provision.)

I seemed to have lost contact with you.  The last contact was with a Ms. Graham - regarding my coming to Houston for an interview - while I was still living in London.  I am now back in the states - where I spent the last few months working for a dot.com.  Although this internet opportunity was interesting, it was not a viable one.  I guess part of the technology firm shake out.  Therefore I am now interviewing again - with investment banks and insurance companies.  Is Enron still interested in having me come down for an interview?  If so, please let me know how to proceed.  Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

__label__13 My take is that we will have 4 UBS people and then the ERCOT team and someone from credit.  Jim       Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs  I had the same thought last night, as to the QSE agreement, if it is only a month or two until UBS would execute that with ERCOT.  I am hoping that the Enron credit person attending can, if requested, give background on the credit requirements that would be placed on UBS if it became a QSE.  Please let me know the number of attendees when you find out so that we can provide adequate copies for those needing them.  Thanks. -- David        Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs  After thinking about this last night, I would still like to bring to the meeting today at 1pm all the documents that would be necessary for UBS to be "fully" functioning so that we can get this data in front of the UBS legal group.  Jim       Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs  I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).    As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account.   Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:    TXU Energy Trading  BP Energy Company Reliant Energy Services, Inc. Aquila Power Corporation Morgan Stanley capitral Group Constellation Power Source FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc. American Electic Power Service Corporation Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP Calpine Energy Servicces LP Dynegy Marketing & Trade LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority  along with a couple of incumbent utilities:  San Antonio City Public Service Reliant HL&P  If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.        Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs  UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.  Basically, my understanding is the following --  1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer 2.	ERCOT ISO Information QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE  LSE [Portz, David]   N/A  Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement  Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement   3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially 4.	Other  Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.  Thanks,  Jim

__label__9 Friends...  Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron cases he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership".

__label__9 As was previously advised in an earlier memo, and as I am confirming by this  memo, except only in special circumstances, and with the approval of John  Lavorato or Mark Haedicke, the tape retention policy for verbal confirmation  of transactions is one month.  After one month, all tapes are destroyed.   Accordingly, for transactions verbally executed over the phone, you must bear  in mind the following:  1. Although all transactions are to be confirmed as soon as possible, if you  are aware of a transaction that has not been confirmed within one month from  deal execution, you must ensure that the portion of the tape applicable to  your transaction is removed and transcribed prior to tape destruction, by  making a specific request of me, for which I will then obtain the approval of  Mark Haedicke or John Lavorato.  2. If for any other reason you believe it is necessary to retain the taped  record of a transaction beyond the one month period, for example, because of  an actual or anticipated dispute with a counterparty, again you should make a  specific request of me to have that portion of the tape pulled and  transcribed, and I will seek the approval of Mark Haedicke or John Lavorato.  If you have any questions or concerns, please speak to me.  I want to emphasize that although the tapes serve to record the verbal  agreement of the parties, it is also imperative that we maintain a  disciplined records retention policy.  It is therefore imperative that, to  the greatest extent possible, written confirmations are completed and  obtained as soon as possible as the best assurance against future disputes.   Obviously, the inability to establish the terms of a transaction, can result  in having to make amendments to that transactions by way of settlement with  the counterparty or, in the worse case, loss of the transaction, both of  which will result in unacceptable earnings consequences.

__label__5 Thanks.     Andy Zipper@ENRON 07/19/2000 08:27 AM  cc:   Subject: Re:    By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you  do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out  today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that  might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some  serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign  whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many  things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance,  obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we  thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should  discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.  If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content,  we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.  any questions please feel free to call.  -andy

Please email me what you find out.    Have a good weekend!!  Ming ---------------------- Forwarded by Mingcheng Lian/AP/Enron on 05/18/2001  03:48 PM ---------------------------   Thomas/ENRON@enronXgate cc: Mingcheng Lian/AP/Enron@Enron   Subject: RE: La Rosita Plant and North Baja Pipeline  George/Ming,   While you are investigating the pipelines, also see if you can find out the  tariff that Sempra charges to transport gas from the California border to  Mexico/Baja.  We are in discussions with Sempra regarding possible joint  activities, so your investigation should be cautious.  I don't want to  disturb Sempra, but I would like to find out how the transportation works:   transport rate, fuel charge, etc.  Kurt       Subject: Re: La Rosita Plant and North Baja Pipeline  George,  Thanks for the concise and informative summary.  The cost data and schedule  information is of particular interest to me.  Would you continue your investigation concerning the following:  1. I would like to know what the existing pipeline distribution system looks  like in that area.  2. Can we get a map of the pipelines and power plants down the west coast of  Baja  3. What are the intentions of the competition in that area.  4. What are the major requirements to do work in the area,  both onshore and  offshore.  Let me know what you guys can dig up. Of course confidentiality at this stage  is of paramount importance.  Best regards  Mike         cc: Mingcheng Lian/AP/Enron@Enron  Subject: La Rosita Plant and North Baja Pipeline  << File: La Rosita Plant and North Baja Pipeline.doc >>   Mike,  We have put together a one page summary of the North Baja Pipeline and the La  Rosita plant.

__label__1 Requested form of GTC Confirmations attached:       ---------------------- Forwarded by Larry Joe Hunter/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000  03:10 PM ---------------------------   cc: Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larry Joe  Hunter/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Canadian Sample forms of ISDA Agreements & Confirmations  Chris,  Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a  Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.  With the governmental, the  proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be  modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).   As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are  getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may  want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any  governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let  me know and I'll send you down the revisions.  By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him  to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto  for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up  transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not  include the reps and warranties required to transact with such  counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to  execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with  some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.

__label__11 A fun-filled bachelor party at a strip club called the Pretty Kitty turned deadly recently when a 32-year-old groom-to-be who was enjoying the attentions of a well-endowed stripper suffocated while his face was buried in her 72-DD breasts. According to investigators, the man was enjoying a lap dance from a stripper named Kandy Kane when disaster struck. She began giving him a lap dance, shaking her breasts in his face. The more she shook, the deeper the man got lost in her cleavage. Before long, his friends noticed he was no longer moving. The man's family is suing Miss Kane and the Pretty Kitty for wrongful death.

__label__7 John,  I will take the lead and develop a recommendation for monteizing the allowances.  I'll give you a call later today to discuss some potential options. Thanks, Trevor       Subject:	RE: Meeting - Emission Credits for MeOH Plant (EB12C2)  The Air Liquide offer is in hand and we will most likely reject it.  Candy Kyle does not believe that declaring the plant "shutdown" for TNRCC purposes would present a problem under the lease,  since we could still start the plant back up in the future.    Would one of you please take the lead in developing a recommendation for monetizing these credits and/or allowances?  We need  to lay this out for Mr. Prentice and Mr. Horton fairly soon.  Thanks for the help,  JNG      Subject:	RE: Meeting - Emission Credits for MeOH Plant (EB12C2)  Gentlemen, Thank you all for taking the time to meet with us today.   I hope we were able to shed some light on what is a convoluted process.  Though the process can be difficult there is some value which we will deliver to Enron.  I've jotted down some next steps from the meeting.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.  Next Steps 1)	Find out the whether a shutdown declaration to the TNRCC would negatively impact the Methanol Plant write down. a.	If there are negative ramifications how can they be resolved with the understanding that the units could always be restarted with the purchase of more ERCs? i.	Brian Hendon has offered his help with your accountants and experts. b.	The question is important because it determines whether VOC and NOx can be turned into ERCs. i.	If there is no issue then 1.	The opportunity to monetize VOC ERCs and NOx ERCs or allowances would exist ii.	If declaring a shutdown negatively impacts the write down:  1.	Any present VOC value would be lost. 2.	There would be no option of taking NOx ERCs. 3.	The sole emissions value would be in the NOx allowances. 2)	Marc Phillips or Mike Taylor will check if there is any emissions penalty or devaluation for not declaring the shutdown immediately. 3)	Let's speak after we know the answers to question 1 or after Air Liquide comes in with an offer.  Thanks again for your time, Trevor Woods 3-3810       Subject:	Meeting - Emission Credits for MeOH Plant (EB12C2)  EB12C2 has been reserved at 2:00 PM Wednesday 10/3 for a discussion re: monetization options for the various emission credits/allowances at the methanol plant.  Your attendance is requested.  Thanks, John Goodpasture
__label__10 Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for  years (Published July 24, 2001)  The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more  intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee  sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn  over internal documents.  Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has  adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple  investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has  become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.  At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted  criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. "I would love  to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a  tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said. With  less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based  companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor  suppliers to California.  Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that  Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of  President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the  rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are  interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also  filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading  data.  Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating  Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality  agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph  Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a  report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction."  Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's  happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears  about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would  data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data  be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands  of class-action attorneys?  Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will  be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative  purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of  turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was  leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state  Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that  private lawyers are working closely with investigators.  Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove  collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few  dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings,  that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create  artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted  the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent  System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that  ISO had ordered the plant operational changes.  Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now  under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents  that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation.  Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary.  Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help  in properly getting this information out." But Aguirre, in an interview, said  he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides.  The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes  will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at  least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their  utility bill checks.

__label__13 Hey Ding.  If you recall, we looked at Southern Cone during July, as this  was the feedback that we got from our presentation in late May.  The Cuiaba  gas and power volumes may be found in several different places since there is  more than one model.  The models do not necessarily agree with each other.  I  have attached a few models that should contain the necessary info.  I also  have a summary sheet template that was to be attached in MAPS.  Enjoy.  -Kevin K.
__label__9 Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The information provides further details about:  -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge; -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications; -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties;  -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.  This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.    Restatement of Earnings  Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:  Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:  -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997 -- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998 -- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999  -- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000 -- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001  -- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001 -- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.    The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.  The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.  You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.  We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

__label__11 Lawrence Spencer 1212 Ashland Avenue Columbus, OH 43212 spencer.120@osu.edu  To Mr. Ken Lay,  I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.  The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Sincerely,  Lawrence Spencer

__label__1 Market Participants:  At the May ISO Governing Board meeting the Board directed Management to bring back to the Board a recommendation on the "parameters and process" for proceeding with a competitive solicitation (Valley-Rainbow RFP) to determine if there are cost-effective and reliable alternatives to SDG&E's proposed Valley-Rainbow transmission project. The specific Board motion can be found at: http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/BOG/documents/motions/20000525/Board/SDGEValle yRainbow500KVProject.htm <http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/BOG/documents/motions/20000525/Board/SDGEVall eyRainbow500KVProject.htm>  and additional information on the project can be found at http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/planning/sdge500kvtrans.html. <http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/planning/sdge500kvtrans.html> These matters are scheduled to be addressed at the August 1 Board meeting. Attached is a memo that outlines ISO Management's preliminary thoughts and recommendations on how to structure the process for conducting and the parameters of the Valley-Rainbow RFP.  Please provide us your thoughts and feedback on these matters no later COB Friday, July 21.  Please send your comments to: sgreenleaf@caiso.com <mailto:sgreenleaf@caiso.com> and btheaker@caiso.com <mailto:btheaker@caiso.com> . While the recommendations outlined below are clearly a work-in-progress, it is imperative that we receive your substantive feedback early so that we can develop a fair and reasonable final recommendation.

__label__14 Family and Friends,  I just received this e-mail from a  girlfriend of mine and wanted to share  her first hand accounts with you.   It put a lump in my throat and brought  tears to my eyes.  I ache for those  people, all people, our nation and our world.  May God bless you, and  may you feel blessed each and every day by his presence!    Love,  Robyn       Subject: Update  Hi,  First, let me thank you again  for your thoughts and concerns.   I did make it out of the city for a  long weekend and truly got to unwind.  Many people out in the Hamptons are  contributing to the cause in several  ways and like the rest of the country the  mood is somber. However, life is still beautiful there.  I rode my bicycle  everyday, canoed, walked on the beach and went to interesting dinners.  But  then I came back.  The bus I  was on was stopped and searched before  entering the Midtown tunnel, which  leads into the city.   Everyone,  including the driver was asked for pictur e ID.  I came back because Monday  evening started the Jewish New Year and  I had dinner with my family in the city.   After dinner, my brother-in-law, my cousin (visiting from Israel) and I  went downtown to ground zero.  It  is off limits to anyone other than the  military, firefighters and the poli ce, but I got this unique opportunity to  enter the belly of the beast beca use my friend who has a restaurant down in  Tribeca set up a hot meal zone  in one of the damaged buildings.  He and his  staff are the only non offici als allowed there.  I went to help serve.   Getting down was a struggle in  itself.  I passed through many  blockades guarded by the military, and fina lly had a police escort get me all  the way down.  No matter how I describe what I saw, I couldn't possibly  give an accurate picture of the devastati on.  The only thing I can tell you  is that it is so much larger in life.   The piece of facade of one of the  towers that you have seen on the news an d in all the papers spans one full city  block.  There were firefighting cr ews from California, Ohio, Indiana and  more.  I spoke with many.  Yesterday I went to synagogue.  The  experience was intense.  We waited on  a line that went around the block  before going through metal detectors to  get in.  I sat next to a Managing  Director of Cantor Fitzgerald, who was l ate to work on Tuesday.  He lost  all 200 of his staff as well as 500 who d id not work directly for him.  The  woman in front of me lost her son.  We  had several firefighters visit the  temple and, as you can imagine, they wa lked into a full five minutes of cheers  and applause.  It was so touching. No dry eyes.  I realize I'm  rambling but thought you might be interested in a first hand account.  All  my best to you,  Joyce  Joyce Zylberberg  tel: 212 661-3580  cel: 917  837-0073  joycetz@mindspring.com

I have detected a tendency to implement different  approaches to valuation in the past.   To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal  rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques  which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the  originators to control the outcomes.   Vince      stevestock@pagenetips.com on 01/19/2001 06:53:14 PM     cc:  Subject:  Valuation    Vince,   I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.   I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK  traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while  here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.   We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation  piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA  portcalc.   I need to break through the pride barriers and the "not built here"  syndrome, and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that  without you guidance.   I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these  systems.

__label__5 The Enron Europe legal department has grown steadily over the five years  since Enron=01,s merchant business was introduced into the UK in 1995 and   continues to grow, currently comprising some thirty lawyers in four  countries. In order to align the legal department as closely as possible wi th  Enron Europe's business units, to streamline the management of the departme nt  and to clarify for all which lawyers within the department specialise in  which areas of Enron Europe=01,s activities, the following new groups withi n the  department will be created with effect from Tuesday 2nd January 2001, each   reporting to myself as General Counsel:    Asset Management and Origination / EES   Headed by Jon Chapman, this group will deal with all legal work relating to   Enron Europe=01,s existing and future asset positions (which include the TP L,  ETOL, Trakya, Sarlux and Nowa Sarzyna power stations and the Arcos project) ,  Enron=01,s retail power business: Enron Direct throughout Europe, and all E ES  business. This group will also handle human resource related matters.  Reporting to Jon will be Alan Black, Sarah Gregory, Chris Wood, Stephan  Dewald, Stephen Hands, Tim Underdown (in his TPL legal capacity) and Annett e  Patrick.   Finance / Continental Trading and Origination   Marcus Von Bock will head this group which will deal with Enron Global  Finance transactions (monetisation, securitisation and capital market relat ed  transactions) and all gas and power origination and trading matters  throughout continental Europe. Mark Elliott, Martin Rosell, Michael Schuh a nd  Michael Slade will report to Marcus.   Technology and Global Markets   Justin Boyd will head this group which will deal with all European work  relating to all of Enron=01,s internet based trading platforms, including E nron  OnLine, Enron Credit.com and Clickpaper.com. This group will also handle al l  Enron Global Markets=01, work in Europe, including weather, currency, equit y,  interest rate, FX, and commodity derivatives, crude and products, coal,  emissions, LNG and paper and pulp trading. Robert Quick, Rahul Saxena, Ian   Brungs and Lorna Jones will report to Justin.   UK Energy/Credit/Metals   Paul Simons will head this group which will deal with all UK power and gas   trading and origination transactions (including the effort to amend existin g  power contracts to ensure their viability in the new bilateral trading  market) all metals and softs related work and work originated by Enron  Credit.com. Adam Duguid, Denis O=01,Connell, Ed Cooper and Matt Dawson will   report to Paul.   As before:   - the Broadband Services Group continues to be headed by Mary Nell Browning   reporting to myself and to Kristina Mordaunt (General Counsel Enron Broadba nd  Services) in Houston;   - the Company Secretarial Group continues to be headed by Sue Kelly reporti ng  to me. Cindy Buckley reports to Sue; and   - the Regulatory Group continues to be headed by Jonathan Marsh, reporting  to  me. Jon Barrett and Julie Russell report to Jonathan.   A chart showing the new structure is attached for your information.   This restructing of the group will inevitably result in some work being  transitioned from the lawyer currently responsible to lawyers within the  appropriate group. This will be achieved gradually over time (beginning Q1   2001) so as to prevent any disruption to ongoing transactions.   Please join me in congratulating Jon, Marcus, Justin and Paul on their  expanded roles.    Mark Evans

__label__8 Hello everyone! Just wanted to send a quick note to let those of you who don't know already  that I will be moving into a new position within the next week or so and will  no longer be the Reporting Contact for the Natural Gas Teams.  I am moving  over to manage the Reporting Groups for the Back Office and Group Teams.   Please welcome Laynie East as my replacement.  She can be reached at X3-3131  and you may begin calling her with any Natural Gas Team related needs  immediately. I will certainly be assisting in the transition process and will assist her  with any of your requests on an as needed basis for a while.  Please forward  this note to anyone in your groups who may need this information.  It has been a pleasure working with each of you over the last several months.  Thanks, Edie
__label__1 George: We need to be able to demonstrate some measurable benefit to Enron in doing this.  Since we are not making any post-bankruptcy settlement payments, pushing the payment date back is not enough.  What other benefit would there be?  Why again does the customer want to do this?  Carol St. Clair EB 4539 713-853-3989 (phone) 713-646-3393 (fax) 281-382-1943 (cell phone) 8774545506 (pager) 281-890-8862 (home fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com      Subject:	   Carol, in regards to our discussion yesterday evening.  I have a customer who wants to roll some of his hedges back a few months.  We are "out of the money" on the hedges.  The roll will be done where it does not change our liability.  This is better for ENE because it pushes our liabilities due out into the future by about six months.  Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks for your help.  GNG X35222
__label__13 Paul, You are correct...for us Core Procurement is just another customer. We keep records on all customers that us our storage program. The change was just to acknowledge that fact.

__label__9 FYI - we had a bomb threat this am. ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 11/07/2000 12:05 PM -----  Karen Denne 11/07/2000 11:25 AM   cc:  Subject: EBS Update  Shelly just called with some updated (and revised) information:  The location of the threat was our Loop Central Office, 4828 Loop Central  Drive, suite 620.  It's an office building, and we have about 50 IT and  software engineers in that office.  There is no signage identifying Enron on  the building or on the suite.  One of our employees in the office received  the call.  The police responded, evacuated and searched the building but did  not find anything.  All employees have returned to the building.  Ch. 13 was  at the site briefly.

On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they  should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other  products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally  and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a  correct interpretation?

The list for Australian weather is  fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral  requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we  do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These  are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not  linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading  Australian power and weather.  Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and  weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to  trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to  check this one out further.

__label__13 Jim:  Per our conversations, I propose the following additions to your draft memo:  Global Trading --  All lawyers providing legal services for trading  activities (anywhere in the world) will continue to be consolidated into one  group reporting to Mark Haedicke.  Legal Risk Books -- Mark will undertake an Enron-wide long term project to  categorize legal risks into standardized risk "books".  To that end, Mark  will form a team to work closely with each General Counsel or her/his  designee regarding the significant legal risks in each subsidiary company.  The goal will be to help us better understand our legal risks on a  consolidated basis and to provide additional tools to manage our legal risks  day to day.  It is anticipated that a consolidated monthly legal risk report  will be prepared for Enron.

__label__7 ENA Legal (TBD) 1. ENA Legal is responsible for deal documentation and legal sign off for the  transaction, and is typically responsible for all transaction-related  agreements documents such as MOUs/MOIs, Participation or Development  Agreements, and any Agreement, which directs the operation of the project  (O&M Agreement, Steam Agreement, Gas Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement,  etc.).    2. ENA Legal represents the interests of  advises the origination and  development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all  legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as  required. and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups.    3. ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax  in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as  required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the  structure.   Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA: 1. EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting  documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been  agreed.   2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at  the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same  project. ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of  any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance  with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained. 3. Comments returned to EE&CC  need to either be incorporated in the next  draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with  the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to  vendors. 4. EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to  both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as  possible.  Forms of "standard" agreements should be discussed/agreed to  enhance consistency. 5. Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction  which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should  be prepared by EECC.  EECC should provide information concerning the  existence of such service agreements. 6.  ENA Legal would should work closely with EE&CC contract administrators in  drafting equipment in the preparation of contracts which the contracts  personnel have been tasked to prepare. EECC Legal can assist by providing  input, but is not required by ENA to sign off on such contracts.

__label__5 market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants  On October 17, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.  The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.

__label__11 I'm in.  A;lso, I don't think we have settled up on Mom and Dad's xmas  present yet.  What do I owe?    "Rob Kean" <rob.kean@worldnet.att.net> 02/05/2001 09:05 PM Please respond to rob.kean   Melissa Kean \(E-mail\)" <skean@enron.com>, "Melissa Kean \(E-mail\)"  <kean@rice.edu> cc:  Subject: Phil's Birthday  It's alittle early to be talking about Phil's birhtday but I have had some conversations with him about replacing his PC with a more modern one that I will build for him.  I want to know if you want to go in with me. He'll get the PC in the near future but I don't expect anyone to contribute until his birthday.  Here's the way it would work: we give Phil a new PC, I send an old Compaq of ours to Kathy and Alan Wedig, Phil sends his old PC to some friends of mine who live in Duluth, MN.  That means that our entire family will be connected.  If not, I would send the Old Compaq to Phil otherwise and then he could send his old one to Kathy and Alan.  The only problem with this scenario is that Phil's old PC is getting a little too old.  Our friends in Duluth wouldn't mind getting an old PC because they've never owned one.  I thought that Phil would benefit the most from getting a brand new PC.  The old Compaq is will still be okay for a while and Kathy should be fine with it.  What do you guys think?  If i do this right, Kathy would have a PC for her birhtday in March.  Rob

__label__13 Talked to Mark Hodge from the PX this morning regarding the charges on our  statement.  He said that the daily block forwards transaction fee has been  waived for July and Aug. (.02 transaction charge).  However, the tariff was  changed on May 2nd that increased the settlement (aka clearing) charges to  .03 per mwh per day.  I asked him why the daily block forwards are so expensive when we get the .01  charge as a preferred customer on the term block forwards.  He said it's  because of the costly bookout process.  I told him we do financial onlys, but  not bookouts, and restated that .03 is more expensive than brokers.  He said  that because the tariff filing of .03 was the maximum, these fees can be  negotiated away from the .03 max., especially since we don't add to the costs  of bookouts.   So, whoever among us is the queen or king of daily block  forwards, or our block forward accounts in general, I suggest we do negotiate  a lower rate on the daily schedules.  Both Brett and I tried to access the tariff on the PX website, but we  couldn't read it.  So, if someone has better clearance or web tools than us,  please let us know so we can update ours.

Emshwiller  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal   10/19/2001  The Wall Street Journal  C1  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, A ndrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.  The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms  of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.  Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capit al increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, whic h was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.  The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investor s in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow  as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicate s the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction  early.  The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders an d analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putti ng the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing  LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wach ovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credi t Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.  Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuou s time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming th e nation's biggest energy-trading company.  This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured bus iness initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $6 18 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on inve stments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix  Corp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million, was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That terminati on also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as th e company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM 2 deals.  At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9% , or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80  a share.  Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document . Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at help ing hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding source s of capital.  Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In la te July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron  officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareho lders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been w ith the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managin g company investments.  Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe hi s relation to LJM2.  In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394  million, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of ret urn at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a declin e in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related ener gy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target , though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals.  In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in "Raptor III," wh ich involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a se t price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron t o settle the investment early, "causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million cap ital invested plus $10.5 million in profit," the report said. The renegotia tion was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced L JM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indic ated.   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.     Enron CFO Profited From Partnerships With Company, WSJ Reports  2001-10-19 01:00 (New York)    Houston, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Chief Financial  Officer Andrew Fastow realized profits through a limited  partnership that did business with Enron, the Wall Street Journal  reported, citing an internal partnership document.   LJM2 Co-Investment LP, of which Fastow is a general partner,  made millions of dollars on transactions with Enron, the paper  said. Fastow and possibly a handful of partnership associates made  $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in  capital increases on an investment of about $3 million in the  partnership, the paper said.   Enron shareholder Fred Greenberg filed a lawsuit yesterday,  alleging that Enron's board cost the company at least $35 million  by allowing Fastow to manage partnerships that bought Enron  assets. Enron reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from  failed investments.    The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week  By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>  Staff Reporter  TheStreet.com  10/19/2001 06:59 AM EDT  URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10002661.html>   1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?  One beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR -  news - commentary) , the German chemical maker, which has seen its share pr ice gain 10.4% since the terrorist attacks. But investors bidding up the st ock might be getting ahead of themselves.  Bayer makes Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand fo r Cipro is high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of the compan y's overall revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year (and, accor ding to analysts, will increase even more this year, due to its acquisition of Aventis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put  the demand for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S. sales of the drug to be approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001.  Even emergency purchases of Cipro probably won't add that much to Bayer's o verall revenues. The president has asked for $643 million for antibiotics t o combat bioterrorist attacks. While it's possible that sum will be increas ed, not all the money would be spent on Cipro.  Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Ci pro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, there's some pressur e in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other m anufacturers.  On another front, Bayer is currently battling a class-action lawsuit relate d to an anti-cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths. It was forc ed to withdraw the drug from the market.  Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean it's a re fuge for investors.  2. Losses at Twice the Price  You know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double  the price of the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (IT WO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , the supply-chain software maker. After mar ket close on Tuesday, the company posted losses under generally accepted ac counting principles that amounted to $5.5 billion, or $13.25 per share, for the latest quarter, including all charges.  In other words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share pri ce, which closed at $5.69 before the announcement.  Much of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the purchase of Aspect Development in March 2000.  To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like i2  typically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges and extraordin ary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so bad: The compa ny met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.3 million, or 13 cents per share.  Still, investors met i2's earnings with disapproval, knocking the stock dow n 25% the day after they were reported.  3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks  In times like these, there's comfort in knowing business goes on as usual a t many U.S. companies. Just like the old days, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq - new s - commentary) is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a comp etitor.  It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the wo rds "Microsoft Server Crunch" to customers of rival server software maker N ovell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained "a number of false and mis leading statements" intended as putdowns of Novell products.  Among the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged food. For example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a line  on the Microsoft boxes read: "What's the expiration date on that NetWare pl atform?" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly funny engi neers.)  The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consultin g services, which Novell says isn't true.  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intende d to advertise Microsoft services, not to slight Novell. "It was all in the theme of a mock cereal box," he said. "It was a modest campaign."  In response to Novell's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter in  September to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements, and it's just agreed to send another letter to appease the company. For the re cord, Novell said it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money da mages.  4. AMD's Feisty Pledge  CEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probably would be too m uch to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes their oratorical r ough edges cross the line into embarrassing.  Case in point: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devic es (AMD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which earlier this week reported a loss for the first time in almost three years. The company, facing harsh pricin g competition from Intel (INTC:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , said its reven ue was down 22% from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for  the fourth quarter.  Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to be  extended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference call, h e indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-called "H ammer" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, "We feel that when th e upturn comes, we're going to kick ---."  Does this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders, mee t Mr. Reeves.  OK, so we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But his comment seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will look b etter when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime soon,  what matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges notwith standing.  5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style  Analysts have complained for some time about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - com mentary) rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company produce d results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they cam e from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has gott en even more unsettling.  To cap off its disappointing earnings results this week -- Enron posted a s teep loss after taking a $1.01 billion charge -- the company let drop that  its shareholder equity had decreased by $1.2 billion.  In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to the "removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares." According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased 55 million shares iss ued through a series of transactions involving LJM Capital, a partnership t hat until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO.  TSC's Peter Eavis has written that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy E nron stock.  Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this week that it h ad expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to quiet its acc ounting critics.  Enron's transactions have been so labyrinthine that it's hard to identify e xactly if or how they were inappropriate. But the latest revelation, to say the least, does nothing to bolster the company's credibility. Enron, whose CEO resigned unexpectedly in August, had seen its stock fall 59% for the y ear leading up to its latest earnings release. Since then, it's dropped ano ther 12.6%    The New Power Company Revises Its Netting Agreement With Enron; Provides Fo r Receivables and Inventory Financing   10/19/2001  Business Wire  (Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)   PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The New Power Company ("New Power"), a wholly owned subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NPW) t oday filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting that it has revised its master netting agreement with Enron North America  Corp., Enron Energy Services, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (togeth er, the "Enron Subsidiaries").  The amendment affects the Master Cross-Product Netting, Setoff, and Securit y Agreement (the "Master Netting Agreement") among NewPower and the Enron S ubsidiaries, and expands through January 4, 2002, the types of collateral t hat NewPower is permitted to post to the Enron Subsidiaries.  The effect of the amendment is to reduce, through January 4, 2002, the amou nt of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron Subsid iaries. Under the amended Master Netting Agreement, the first $70 million o f posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivabl es and inventory of NewPower, valued at discounts specified in the amendmen t, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. Pledging receivable s and inventory is consistent with NewPower's previously announced intentio n to secure asset-backed financing.  With the amendment and NewPower's cost reduction efforts, and absent a simi lar rate of decline in commodity prices or other significant events, NewPow er believes that it has sufficient financial resources to conduct its busin ess until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing, which will be necessar y upon the expiration of the amendment. NewPower has been and is actively s eeking to arrange asset-backed financing with other parties, although to da te no such arrangements have been secured.  The Company expects to meet its previous estimate of net loss and loss per  basic and diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2001. How ever, customer count and revenues are expected to be slightly lower than pr eviously forecast.  The Company will provide revised guidance for the fourth quarter 2001 and a n outlook for 2002 on its third quarter conference call scheduled for Thurs day, November 8.

All Rights Reserved.      LOBBYING  K Street's Top 10: The Shifting Lineup  Shawn Zeller   10/20/2001  National Journal  Copyright 2001 by National Journal Group Inc. All rights reserved.   How do the Washington lobbying firms with the heftiest incomes put themselv es in the upper echelon of K Street practitioners? Van Scoyoc Associates In c. does it by signing up a stable of smaller clients and working hard to re tain them. Quinn Gillespie & Associates doesn't have a long client list, bu t it is at the top of the heap in terms of average fee per client. Greenber g Traurig, meanwhile, lured away a rival firm's top rainmaker-and his lucra tive book of clients.  These are just some of the business strategies revealed in National Journal 's survey of the 10 Washington lobbying firms with the highest fee income f rom January 1 to June 30. The four top firms at midyear 2001 are the same o nes as a year earlier: perennial powerhouses Cassidy & Associates Inc.; Pat ton Boggs; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; and Verner, Liipfert, Bernhar d, McPherson and Hand.  But two new players-boasting huge growth rates-are among the firms nipping  at the heels of these top dogs.  Greenberg Traurig, which came in at No. 5 in National Journal's midyear 200 1 rankings, had never before been in the top tier of Washington lobbying fi rms. According to PoliticalMoneyLine, which compiles a comprehensive annual list of all lobbying firms, Greenberg Traurig had the 35th-highest income  during the first six months of last year.  And No. 7 in the midyear 2001 rankings is Quinn Gillespie, another first-ti me member of the top 10. Formed just a year and a half ago by former Clinto n White House Counsel Jack Quinn and Ed Gillespie-a one-time adviser to Hou se Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas-the firm has seen its fortunes rocke t upward. Quinn Gillespie was No. 13 in the first six months of 2000.  In between these two newcomers is Van Scoyoc Associates, ranked at No. 6. T here has been a steady rise for Van Scoyoc, which was No. 28 in fee income  at the end of 1996, the year in which the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act firs t took effect.  Rounding out the top 10 at midyear 2001 are stalwarts Williams & Jensen; Wa shington Council Ernst & Young; and Barbour Griffith & Rogers.  National Journal ranks the top-10 lobbying firms every six months by tallyi ng the fees that firms report to the House and Senate as required under the 1995 legislation. National Journal tabulates total fees for only the 25 to p firms in PoliticalMoneyLine's comprehensive annual survey.  With its $16.68 million in fees for the first six months of the year, Cassi dy & Associates continued to blow away the competition. The last time any f irm reported a six-month total larger than Cassidy's was during the first h alf of 1998, when Verner, Liipfert led the way. During the first six months of this year, Cassidy & Associates received a massive fee of $1 million fr om the Taiwan Studies Institute, a think tank with close ties to the Taiwan ese government; Boeing Co. paid Cassidy & Associates $600,000; and Tiffany  & Co. paid it $400,000 to lobby on legislation that would bar diamonds mine d in conflict-ridden areas of the world from entering the global market.  Despite the economic downturn and the terrorist threat, lobbying goes on, c ompany Chairman Gerald S.J. Cassidy said. "During difficult times, people c ome to Washington with their problems. During more-robust times, they come  seeking opportunities."  But the biggest story at midyear was the rise of Greenberg Traurig. The fir m, which posted just $1.71 million in lobbying fees during the first half o f 2000, saw that amount more than quadruple to nearly $8.7 million this yea r. Much of the credit goes to Jack Abramoff, the conservative K Street move r and shaker who is an ally of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. Last year, Abramoff left his old firm, Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, an d brought $3 million in business with him to Greenberg Traurig. Preston Gat es, which was ranked in the top five during Abramoff's tenure, dropped out  of National Journal's rankings this year. The lobbying firm's fees fell by  nearly 50 percent.  Abramoff continued to make rain at Greenberg Traurig, billing $860,000 to t he Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, $500,000 to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and $300,000 to garment manufacturers that opera te in that U.S. territory. A few new clients also forked over big bucks: th e Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana ($440,000); Voor Huisen Project Management,  a homebuilder with international operations ($300,000); and the American In ternational Center ($100,000). Despite initial concerns among some Greenber g Traurig partners about whether Abramoff would fit in, Abramoff insists th at his team of lobbyists has been "totally integrated" into the firm.  But Abramoff wasn't the only one responsible for Greenberg Traurig's higher earnings. Ronald W. Kleinman, a former State Department lawyer, persuaded  Congress with the help of several Greenberg Traurig colleagues to pass Sect ion 2002 of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. Th is section of the law ordered the Treasury Secretary to use Cuban governmen t funds that are frozen in U.S. banks to compensate the families of three m en who had won multimillion-dollar judgments against Cuba under a 1996 amen dment to the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act. The amendment allows victi ms of terrorism or their families to sue states that are on the U.S. list o f state sponsors of terrorism.  Greenberg Traurig represented the families of Armando Alejandre, Carlos Alb erto Costa, and Mario M. de la Pena-three members of Brothers to the Rescue , a Cuban-American group that rescues Cubans in the waters off Florida. The three men died when their plane was shot down over international waters on February 24, 1996. The families sued Cuba and were awarded $96.7 million i n damages by a U.S. District Court judge in 1997. The State Department oppo sed payment, but President Clinton signed the trafficking bill. Greenberg T raurig reported a fee of $4 million.  Fred W. Baggett, the chair of Greenberg Traurig's governmental practice gro up, said this was a one-time fee, but he added that the Cuban case "establi shed a platform so that the firm can support undertaking those one-time eff orts in the future," and noted, "We have a few coming down the pipeline."   Baggett said the firm has cases involving an American killed in Jerusalem b y the Palestinian group Hamas, and Americans who were used as human shields in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. None of the Americans was killed, and all were eventually released.  Taking the flip side of the mega-fee approach was Van Scoyoc Associates, wh ich reported receiving no fee above $180,000. Nonetheless, the firm continu ed its steady rise. A key reason, said firm President H. Stewart Van Scoyoc , was the ability to recruit and retain clients. The firm signed up 34 clie nts between January 1 and June 30, while only nine out of 159 clients termi nated contracts during the period.  "We work hard at defining the relationship with a client before we sign a c ontract," said Van Scoyoc. "We make sure we're clear on the goals and objec tives, and in a typical relationship, we don't guarantee that we can do eve rything." The firm's $6.24 million total for the first half of 2001 was 23  percent higher than its fees for the same period last year.  Quinn Gillespie's ascent into the top 10 was more along the lines of Greenb erg Traurig's. Quinn Gillespie's billings were almost $6.09 million at midy ear 2001, a 71 percent rise over the same period last year. The firm has on ly 34 paying clients, but the average fee per client-$180,000-is the highes t among the top 10. During the six months, the British Columbia Lumber Trad e Council paid a fee of $540,000 to Quinn Gillespie, while Enron Corp. paid $525,000. The Canadian group hoped its high-powered lobbyists would win gr eater access for Canadian lumber in the United States, but U.S. tariffs wer e reinstated earlier this year. Lobbying for Enron focused on energy deregu lation, particularly in California. Enron is a major creditor of Southern C alifornia Edison, the utility whose financial woes resulted in power shorta ges in California last summer.  Quinn Gillespie's staff has grown from nine at the time of the founding to  nearly 30 today. "We like to think we have a toolbox here-people who may be Republicans or Democrats but who also have different skills that benefit t he client," Quinn said.  Patton Boggs had fees of $10.26 million in the first six months of 2001, bu t that was just a 5 percent rise over the same period in 2000. Still, the f irm leapfrogged over Verner, Liipfert to capture the No. 2 ranking. Patton  Boggs earned $360,000 from Russia's government-owned NTV television network , which was at the center of a controversy earlier this year when the gover nment took over the independent network and ousted its staff.  Akin, Gump also jumped past Verner, Liipfert to No. 3 in the rankings, post ing $9.48 million in fees-a 16 percent increase over a year earlier. Akin,  Gump's biggest client was the troubled tire manufacturer Bridgestone/Firest one Inc., which paid just over $1.5 million in fees. Akin, Gump also earned big money from AT&T ($800,000) and the Gila River Indian Community ($620,0 00).  At No. 4, Verner, Liipfert saw the biggest drop in fees, taking in $8.84 mi llion in the first six months of 2001-down 16 percent from the same period  in 2000. Verner, Liipfert lost lucrative contracts with Puerto Rico after t he government there changed hands last year. (See this issue, p. 3273.)  Rounding out the top-10 rankings, Williams & Jensen at No. 8 billed $5.68 m illion, a 12 percent increase over the first half of 2000, while Washington Council Ernst & Young saw its fees drop 11 percent to $5.5 million. The fi rm fell four places to No. 9 in the rankings. Barbour Griffith & Rogers's f ee income was up 7 percent to $5.48 million, putting the firm at No. 10.  Falling out of the midyear top-10 rankings were Preston Gates-No. 6 at midy ear 2000-and PricewaterhouseCoopers, No. 7 last year. PricewaterhouseCooper s's billings were $5 million for the period, a 6 percent drop from the firs t half of 2000.   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Oct. 19, 2001  Houston Chronicle  Houston entrepreneurs added to Texas Business Hall of Fame  By TOM FOWLER  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle  The Texas Business Hall of Fame's annual awards ceremony Thursday night hon ored four Houston business leaders.  The event at the George R. Brown Convention Center put the spotlight on Wei ngarten Realty Investors Chairman Stanford Alexander; Compaq Computer found er and former Chief Executive Officer Rod Canion; retired Reliant Energy Ch airman and CEO Don Jordan; and Dynegy Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson.  This is the 19th year the nonprofit Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation  has honored the state's business leaders with a dinner and induction event.   As chairman of Weingarten Realty Investors, Stanford Alexander built the co mpany into one of the nation's largest publicly traded real estate companie s.  After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Alexander joined J. Weingarten, a Hous ton-based chain of 87 supermarkets. He later became an executive with Weing arten Markets Realty Co., an affiliated real estate firm that developed fre e-standing supermarket stores.  The firm later changed its name to Weingarten Realty. The Houston-based com pany is now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  Weingarten owns shopping centers, warehouses and other property in 17 state s from coast to coast.  Weingarten's notable developments in Houston include the upscale Village Ar cade near Rice University and the Centre at Post Oak, across from the Galle ria.  Rod Canion came up with the idea behind Compaq in 1982 after a trip to a lo cal ComputerLand store. Along with colleagues from Texas Instruments, Jim H arris and industrial designer Ted Papajohn, Canion envisioned a portable co mputer that ran all the programs that operated on the IBM PC.  By the next year, the company was producing the original Compaq luggable co mputer, a move that essentially created the modern PC industry. By 1987, it s fifth year, the company made business history by breaking $1 billion in s ales, the fastest pace ever for a corporate startup.  Canion left Compaq in October 1991 but continued to be active in other vent ures. In 1992, he founded Insource Technology Group, a consulting services  and network engineering firm, and continues to serve as chairman.  Don Jordan has been in the forefront of Houston business and society for de cades. And even though he retired from the post of chairman and chief execu tive at Reliant Energy in late 1999, he has remained active in the city's g rowth and development.  Jordan was with Reliant and its predecessor Houston Industries for 44 years and helped position the company for its eventual split between the company 's regulated businesses, such as HL&P and Entex, and unregulated business t hat is now called Reliant Resources.  Jordan, along with his corporate rival Ken Lay of Enron, was instrumental i n the successful campaign last year to convince voters to approve the use o f public funds to build a new arena downtown for the Houston Rockets.  Jordan has spent a lot of time on the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo board  and many other civic groups.  Chuck Watson has built Dynegy into one of Houston's leading energy companie s, but he is more well-known for his forays into the world of sports.  Watson established NGC Corp., Dynegy's predecessor, in 1985 and served as p resident until becoming chairman and chief executive officer in 1989.  Recently Watson was revealed to be the largest investor in the limited part nership assembled to put together the Texans, Houston's National Football L eague franchise. It begins playing next year.  Watson also owns the Aeros, Houston's American Hockey League team.  Watson's support was also pivotal to getting voters last year to approve th e use of public funds for the new downtown arena. Watson had opposed an ear lier deal to use public money to build the facility.  Watson has also been a strong supporter of Houston's bid to land the 2012 O lympic Games.  To date, the foundation has awarded more than $1.8 million in scholarships  to students pursuing business degree at Texas colleges and universities.   Recession, Budget Cuts, Travel Fears To Subdue LME Week  By Mark Long  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   10/19/2001  Dow Jones Commodities Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The many travails of the metals industry will dampen t he spirits of those who make it to the annual round of meetings and parties at London Metal Exchange Week, which starts Monday.  In what is expected to be a much smaller group of delegates than usual, con versations will be dominated by fears of global recession smothering alread y-lousy demand, the increasingly pressing need for production cuts, and the exit of several important participants from the metals business.  Cuts in companies' travel budgets and fears of flying are keeping many of t he usual attendees away from London this year, dealers and analysts said.   "Sentiment is going to be bearish, and we've just heard in the past few day s of people who were previously going to come along not coming, largely on  their companies' advice," said Adam Rowley, an analyst at MacQuarie Bank in London.  Indeed, a representative at another major bank said fully half of the guest s expected at its satellite activities have canceled.  Forecasts for base metals demand and average prices have been widely revise d downward in the past few weeks, particularly since the impact of the Sept . 11 terror attacks accelerated the world economic slowdown.  Just this week, Standard Bank ratcheted its expectations lower, with LME ca sh copper - a bellwether for the complex that's especially sensitive to ind ustrial productivity - seen at $1,350 a metric ton in December 2001, down f rom an actual year-to-date average in 2001 of $1,619/ton.  Producers are reluctant to cut copper output, and declining Chinese imports and weak demand in the west mean there is still further downside potential for copper, Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar said.  With demand for base metals slumping so sharply, eyes have been turning to  the producers to make moves on the supply side.  In copper, analysts say U.S. producers are the most likely to cut back, as  the recent strength in the dollar hits their bottom line the hardest. Howev er, a recent slump in energy prices has kept the wolves from the door so fa r for some producers in an industry that's energy-intensive.  Elsewhere, zinc is suffering from a supply glut that recently pressured the LME three-month price to a 17-year low of $766 a metric ton.  The troubles of Australian zinc producer Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS) will surely  be a hot topic, following the company's move to voluntary administration du e to its large debt load, dealers said.  But aside from all the market concerns, the most worrisome topic will likel y be the recent succession of companies bailing out of or reducing their co mmitment to the metals business, market participants said.  In the past week, N.M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. quit the base metals business and ScotiaMocatta - the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia (T.B NS) - removed itself from open-outcry ring trade at the LME. Earlier this m onth, Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Europe, and all th ese moves follow Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. ditching its market-making  activities in the metals business earlier this year.  Who's next?  "It could be anyone," is the refrain from nearly all market participants su rveyed.  -By Mark Long, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9356; mark.long@dowjones .com   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

HC to hear DPC's plea   10/19/2001  The Times of India  Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)   MUMBAI: The Bombay high court will, on December 11, begin hearing a petitio n filed by Enron-promoted Dhabol Power Company (DPC), challenging the juris diction of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to adju dicate the US-based multinational's dispute with Maharashtra State Electric ity Board (MSEB).  A division bench headed by Justice Ajit Shah decided to hear the matter at  a stretch for a week beginning from December 11. The court permitted MERC m embers P. Subrahmanyam and Venkat Chary to be impleaded as respondents. The y have been asked to file affidavits by November 9.  The multinational power giant had levelled certain allegations of bias agai nst an MERC member Jayant Deo. Mr Deo urged the court that he would like to recluse himself from the proceedings.  DPC was allowed to amend its main petition in view of the allegations level led against Mr Deo and were asked to amend it within week.  In his affidavit replying to allegations of bias by the DPC, Mr Deo said he was neutral in his stand as a MERC member.  The court has made it clear that when the hearing in the case commences, tw o intervening parties, US Exim Bank and a consortium of 11 offshore lenders of DPC would not be allowed to make any pleadings. The court, however, sai d they would be permitted to assist the court by making oral submissions.   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

__label__6 That is correct only Australian Power and Weather     cc:    Subject: Re: RUSH APPROVAL-Australia + Japan Weather    David,  A clarification...  On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they  should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other  products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally  and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a  correct interpretation?

The list for Australian weather is  fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral  requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we  do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These  are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not  linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading  Australian power and weather.  Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and  weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to  trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to  check this one out further.

__label__8 We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for  1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES  under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are  the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this  carefully....  SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak  NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak  If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal  entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet  Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell  him to do the same.  Thanks, Kate
__label__3 See below       Subject:	Rescind Offers/Termination Letters    Tim,  (1) We rescinded approximately 8 offers in November. It was decided that individuals who gave up jobs to accept our offer would be paid out one month of salary (with a signed release). I had two people who fell into this category and signed releases but have not received the one month salary. Will they be paid out? [O'rourke, Tim]   will find out.   (2) I have received several calls from terminated employees concerning the termination letters. They are concerned that they have 30 days in which to transfer to their spouse's plan and won't meet the deadline. My understanding is that the terminations letter will be mailed out soon. [O'rourke, Tim]   YES - we're stuffing envelopes as we speak  Please advise?  Regards Frank

__label__11 Hey noonie!  I am going to try to make it to revival as well so I'll bring your invitation. I have one for Robin too. Tasha told me that she told her about it but she didn't say whether she was coming or not. Those are the two places where she is registered. You are a mess talking about you might have to pick something up for yourself. It is hard not to come out of there with something for yourself and I'm sure Todd wouldn't be mad at cha' :o) I have all the games ready for the shower, I sure hope everyone enjoys them.  What is your favorite mascara?      Patrice.L.Mims  cc: 11/02/01 09:14        Subject:     RE: Hi AM       Hope,  I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.  Hugs      Subject:  RE: Hi   Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5 hours because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject is he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating just about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam, especially to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).  I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell her or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address because she had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a chance to.

I hear you two have been shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good. I'm very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".  Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll call you if I do, or just call her for you.  Talk with you later!!!  Hugs        Subject:  Hi   Hey Tricey!  I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been going on? How are the boys?  Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.  Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday but she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either. Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to you. Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer at 4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email address I have one for her too?     ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra.   ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that  would give ENA access to their assets.  In short, ENA wants to offer a  complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small  commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service  for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets  (upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's "Chief Regulatory  Office" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.  Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to  lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to  the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity  offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) "Deal Bench"  services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E  that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the  immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).  Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.  We'll distribute the slides  we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.  Best, Jeff

__label__3 STEVE: I very much appreciate your call the day before yesterday and your asking if I would like to compete to succeed Joe Hillings as head of Enron's Washington office. Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning to Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleased to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter.  In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had any questions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I would have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does she report? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in the Legislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs?  I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it's clear that government relations are  much more central to the work of Enron than at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work. Thanks again for your call, your courtesy, and your indulgence with this tardy line of questioning. With best wishes, CHASE.

__label__7 Gerald:  I have reviewed the documents, and I only have a few proposed changes.    On the responses indicating that Brickhill is providing, I would add "on  behalf of the Chicago Project Shipper Group" at the end of each response.   That would clarify that he is not answering individually for ENA.  We can ask  Doug or Kim about this on the conference call.  In fact, we might not even  need to include those questions where Brickhill is providing the answers.  If you haven't already caught it, on response #20 to Pan Alberta/PAGUS, the  left margin is not right (at least on my copy).  On response 4 to NGPL, I would change the response to "Enron North America is  not providing a reponse to this data request.  Please see objection of the  Chicago Project Shippers Group dated May 10, 2000."  On responses 7, 11, and 13, change the last word to "analyses".  On response 11, fix the unnecessary hyphen in "(opera-tionally, . . .

__label__1 Greetings:   Please review the attached.  It's a summary I've put together of a very  lengthy analysis MRW did for us over the weekend.  I've also attached the   considerably lengthier MRW memo for those who'd like to see it.  The tables   included in the summary are pulled directly from the MRW memo.  The analysi s  only addresses the utilities undercollection (i.e., solvency) and doesn't   address any additional increases that might result from DWR's buying  activities.   The Bottom Line  =06=15 By raising average rates 10% over a 10-year period, California could 1)  return the utilities to solvency, and 2) help close the  supply-demand gap  by  providing customers with better price signals.  =06=15 California could achieve these goals under this new rate structure a nd at  the same time exclude one-third of residential  customers from any increase s.  If California chose not to exclude any customers from the new rate structur e,  California  would only need to raise average rates by about 8.8%.  =06=15 This level of increase is in line with increases enacted in other st ates  (e.g., Washington: 28-34%; Montana: 4.5-32%; Idaho:  6.0-24%; Nevada:  7-12.5%; New Mexico 12%).   We'll need to look at it critically and try to shoot holes in it before goi ng  public with the numbers as part of our broader effort, but it offers a  reasonable benchmark against which to judge alternatives (like spending the   kids lunch money on crumbling, broken down transmission systems).   Please provide feedback as soon as possible, and perhaps, Paul we conclude   the MRW work on the agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily conference ca ll.

__label__13 Bert -   Thank you for the kind words and taking time to communicate your thoughts.  I certainly have a great appreciation of the teams abilities, given the  relentless and sometimes extreme demands that come our way.  Recognition is  not expected, just the nature of our work, but it sure is nice when it  comes.  Thanks again.  - Bill     Enron Investment Partners      cc: Deborah Bubenko/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT, ross_davis@gensler.com, Christina  Yepez/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Thank You - June 16th Move  Bill, this is a note of appreciation for allowing me to work with Deborah  Bubenko and the designers from Gensler, Ross Davis and Vince Flickinger.   Together, they made the floor design for EIP and the entire move from 1400  Smith to 3AC as easy as any move could be.  From beginning to end, they  worked with me to address our needs and were creative in the design.  Deborah  always returned my calls timely or directed me to the correct person.   She  is knowledgeable and has good public relations skills.  Ross is an excellent designer.  Along with Vince, he created space where  there was none and utilized every space available.  The floor plan was  brainstormed, designed and finalized in only three or four official meetings  with Ross.  Yet when the space was completed, all the details discussed were  there.  The space has a "first class" appearance as well as a very efficient  work environment.  It was certainly a pleasure to work with Ross and Vince.   They responded timely, kept me up-to-date and followed through on details  throughout every step of the construction.  The plan to include in the churn process, designated support who help wrap  and pack artwork, fragiles etc. proved to be cost efficient for our move.   This eliminated damage to furniture that required refinishing, touch up or  replacement.  There was less down-time of the assistants because of their  expertise.  They knew what to do, how to do it and they just came in and did  it.   Follow up after the move by Christina Yepez was very customer oriented  and timely.  She seemed always to be here at the right moment to make sure  everything was working.  She efficiently contacted the correct people to get  all loose items completed, voluntarily advised me of the status and was  extremely willing to do whatever was needed.  A special thank you to all the movers.  Especially Jose, Luis, Abel, Gerardo,  Antonio, Alonso and Manuel who did not get to their share of donuts!  Thank  you for my best "churn" experience during my six+ years at Enron.

__label__2 Attached is a draft of taking points I'll use for the conference on Monday.   If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL:   http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  I'm on the "summit's" second panel: "What do we do now?"  I've been asked to  identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the  solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).  There are two documents.  One is a document that I previously distributed and  used as talking points for the Cal. Energy Markets conference last week.  The  other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum.  I have 5-10  meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the  "facilitator."  All comments are appreciated.  Best, Jeff

__label__5 <<...OLE_Obj...>> E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy and public utility law. December 13, 2000  Reactive Power Capability Challenges Future Transmission By Michael J. Zimmer Baker & McKenzie Washington, D.C.  A significant challenge to the transmission providers reported by the National Electric Reliability Council (NERC) will be to maintain adequate levels of reactive support for the transmission system in the era of open market competition in the U.S.  Unlike real power (MW), the reactive component of power (Mvar) cannot be easily transmitted over longer distances and must generally be supplied at the local level.  Without adequate reactive power support, portions of the electric power system can be susceptible to potential voltage collapse or instability according to NERC. Sources of reactive power include generators, synchronous condensers, transmission lines, capacitors, and very specialized reactive support devices generally known as static var compensators (SVCs).  Demand for reactive power is shaped by the size and type of demand, power transactions across the transmission system, and the loading of transmission facilities. This demand for reactive power is growing nationwide.  Decline in Reactive Improvements  Many electric utilities made concerted efforts to improve reactive support as demand grew by adding shunt capacitors on their distribution and subtransmission systems, NERC reports.  However, such distribution reactive improvement programs have declined in recent years within the industry. Reactive support programs must be continuous as demand on the distribution system continues to escalate.  A chief component of that growth in the need for reactive improvement has been air conditioning which particularly requires increasing levels of reactive support.  Most air conditioner demand is motor load, requiring significant reactive power support.  Because of its interaction with the transmission system, reactive support is one area that distribution companies must not ignore if reliability is to be maintained on the bulk transmission system.  The physics of transferring power across a transmission line causes it to consume reactive power, with increased transfers resulting in escalating voltage decline across the line.  When heavy power transfers occur across a transmission system interface and transmission lines are heavily loaded, voltage in the area of the interface can become depressed if sufficient reactive supplies are not available to the system, NERC has stated.  Open Access Impacts  When transfers of power follow a consistent directional pattern, it is relatively easy to plan and justify costs for the required reactive support for the transfers.  For example, significant reactive support was added on the bulk system to enable higher transfers from ECAR to MAAC and the VACAR subregion of SERC in the early 1990s.  However, under open access transmission, transactions are conducted in large numbers across long distances, and often flow in directions that were not anticipated when the transmission system was originally planned and built.  The direction and amount of such transfers has become much more volatile, changing daily, and sometimes hourly.  Consequently, planning reactive support enhancements for improving transfer capability has become more difficult as the pace and level of transactions have become more short-term and real-time.  There is currently no incentive to increase the levels of reactive support on the bulk power system, NERC states.  In fact, there are disincentives, because generators are paid to produce real power, not reactive power under current contracting.  There is a tradeoff between producing real and reactive power because reactive power generation decreases as the real output increases.  A recent spate of nuclear unit upgrades effectively lowered the units' reactive power output capabilities as the real output of these nuclear units was increased.  In the long term, transmission providers must reevaluate their bulk power systems in light of open access, including planning for necessary reactive support.  Business is increasing on the transmission system, but very little is being done to increase the load serving and transfer capability of the bulk transmission system.  This will be essential for supporting development of regional transmission organizations (RTO).  Most of the transmission projects planned over the next ten years are intended to reinforce parts of the system to alleviate local problems.  Future Planning Opportunities  This raises several issues for future planning:  * Can distributed generation become a new market source for reactive power capability? * Can distributed generation become a source of reliable transmission loading relief avoidance? * Is there a third party, competitive market for reactive power?  Is there a merchant reactive power plant market to avoid voltage reduction which should be encouraged? * Who manages this critical bulk power system issue in a post-restructured world?  Generators? Transmission? Distributors? Marketers? * Will this issue become impaired further with distribution company mergers and consolidations? * Will most new transmission gravitate to reinforce the system for local problems management, because of a lack of RTO's and strong regional siting?  Are independent system operator's doing enough to manage this challenge? * Is this another incentive for the power quality market to respond?  The ability to transfer electric energy across interfaces or seams hampers reactive power support.  NERC believes it is a national imperative that reactive power improvements keep pace with the demands being placed on the transmission systems to maintain reliability.  We are already seeing this as an element of key market disruptions.  Reactive power support must ultimately be placed and coordinated among generation, transmission and distribution.  With existing regulatory structures, this could be falling in the cracks with open access transmission, widely varying flow patterns and associated reactive demands have become commonplace and need accommodation. The reactive power support system will need to become more versatile for open access transmission objectives to be achieved, and needs further attention in the RTO formation process for RTO's to be successful and thrive.  ****  DID YOU KNOW?  * According to recent reports by the Edison Electric Institute, the level of transmission investment in the U.S. has declined for over 20 successive years.  * The number of transmission load relief postings has escalated since 1998, transmission congestion is up 40% in 1998-9; and 140% in 1999-2000.  <<Legal & Regulatory Risks.pdf>> ___________________________________________________________________________ E-Notes is a publication of Baker & McKenzie.

__label__8 Teco Tap       30.000 / Enron ; 120.000 / HPL Gas Daily
__label__2 Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.  The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, "Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company."  S&P also said, "[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales."  As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.  It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.  We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.
__label__2 I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours.  Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs, munis, and federal PMA's I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract, it's almost a religion.  One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran.  Whether it's assimilation or merger, or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education, we need to give Mike Small a face-saving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract.  Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPP-ers to stick with the original contract.---"Why should I change, the agreements are virtually identical?"

One is going to be designed to give the marketers "talking points"  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories.   I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of "How Enron views the WSPP" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.     Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements.   This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions.   We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.     Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result.  The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach.   ----cgy             Subject:	Legal Discussion  Christian Yoder has graciously agreed to host a symposium comparing and contrasting the WSPP and the EEI.  The meeting will take place on Oct 31 (Halloween) at 1:00 PM in Mt Bachelor.   Stewart

Sandi    Daren J Farmer 10/16/2000 11:39 AM   cc:  Subject: Re: Rate for Tenaska Deal  Sandi,   Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.    The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated  on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will  be adjusted yearly based on CPI.  Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the  delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals  due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a  daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to  purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at  the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they  are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do  you agree with this?  D      cc:   Subject: Rate for  Tenaska Deal  Daren, When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you  guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me  how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater  of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual  deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year?  based on what index?  Thanks, Sandi

__label__3 Kevin and Jim -- See message below that MISO is selecting the Power Marketer reps for the Advisory Committee.  Mike Roan was our rep.  The note says that the rest of the PM group wants to replace another marketer for Enron.  Practically speaking at this point, we cannot send someone to represent us anyway and would be "rerunning" at some point since we lost Mike.  Mike Roan asks for us to vote for him.  Knowing Mike, he will continue to advocate the type of market structure we want (with, of course, whatever AEP spin he must make -- however, he told me that he can advocate LMP financial rights model).  I think we should vote for Mike.  Ok with you?

I believe that selecting me is in Enron's interest as i am trying to build AEP tradings voice and credibility within the MidWest (the current positions are being driven by the transmission side of the business).  In short, if Enron is comfortable supporting me please send an email to Donna Dare (DDare@midwestiso.org) by 4pm Monday 12/17 stating that Enron supports the nomination of Mike Roan.   regards  Mike   Please let me know the outcome....    ----- Forwarded by Michael J Roan/AEPIN on 12/14/01 01:44 PM -----   "Taylor, David W." <David.Taylor@constellation.com>   12/12/01 06:47 PM      cc:        DDare@midwestiso.org  Subject:        MISO Advisory Committee Power Marketing Representatives     The MISO has requested that each of the sectors identify their Advisory Committee representatives for the 2002-2004 term. Specifically, I am coordinating the selection of the Power Marketing sector representatives. For the past year, Enron and Constellation have represented the Power Marketing sector on the MISO Advisory Committee. With the addition of MAPP to the MISO, a third Power Marketing seat has been added to the Advisory Committee. Constellation's seat is set to expire at the end of the year and the new MAPP seat needs to be filled leaving two seats to fill for the 2002-2004 term (the new seat along with Constellation's). However, at this point in time and considering Enron's current situation, those Power Marketing entities that have been regularly attending the Advisory Committee meetings have proposed to also replace the Enron representative under the belief that Enron cannot properly represent the sector at this time. This results in the filling of all three Power Marketing seats at this time.   The following entities have expressed an interest in being a Power Marketing representative on the MISO Advisory Committee and are hereby the nominees for the Power Marketing sector:  Constellation (Harvey Reed/Dave Taylor) Mirant (Jim Mayhew) AEP (Mike Roan) Detroit Edison (Ron Bauer)  We will hold a secret ballot vote in order to determine the Power Marketing representatives on the MISO Advisory Committee. Donna Dare of the MISO has graciously volunteered her time to receive and tabulate the ballots for our sector as an independent entity. The manner in which we will vote will be that each power marketing company will rank the nominees in order of preference and then e-mail the rankings to Donna Dare at the MISO (DDare@midwestiso.org ). ONLY ONE VOTE PER COMPANY. Donna will apply points to the rankings she receives (4 points for the first preference, 3 points to the second preference, 2 points for the third preference, and 1 point for the forth preference). The two nominees receiving the most points will be assigned a two year term on the MISO Advisory Committee while the nominee with the third highest point total will receive a one year term on the MISO Advisory Committee. Donna will let the sector know whom the selected representatives are and their associated terms but will not release which companies voted for which nominees.  When replying to Donna, please indicate your preferences clearly so that there is no room for interpretation. For example, the following format would be acceptable:  XYZ Company votes for the following nominees to represent the Power Marketing sector on the MISO Advisory Committee:  First Preference: Company xxx Second Preference: Company yyy Third Preference: Company zzz Fourth Preference: Company qqq  Please supply your preferences to Donna (i.e., vote) by 4:00 PM Monday, December 17, 2001.  In addition, the MISO is seeking volunteers from each sector to participate on the MISO Planning Committee. All those interested in volunteering should call me directly as soon possible so that we can provide the MISO with the name of the volunteer from our sector.  Also, I have attached a listing of companies and associated contacts for each of the Power Marketing entities of the MISO. Please review the list and let me know of any changes you would like made.  If you have any questions, please call me at (724) 454-6887.

A snapshot follows:  NEWS CONFERENCE #1 Assemblywoman Carole Migden, Sen. Martha Escutia and others announce  "pro-consumer" bill package designed to reduce energy costs and increase  conservation. 10 a.m., Rm. 1190. Contact: Susannah Churchill 448 4516. Also  participating: Susannah Churchill, CALPIRG, and Paul Fenn, Local Power.  The three pro-consumer bills spotlighted:  AB 48X (Migden): Assemblymember Migden from SF introduced her bill, which she  said uses the idea, "If you buy in bulk, you pay less."  AB 48X would  "authorize customers to aggregate their electric loads as individual  consumers with private aggregators..or as members of their local community  with community choice aggregators."  Assem. Migden said this would give  communities "independent choices about the kind of energy they wish to buy."   She also said this aggregation of electrical purchasing would allow  communities to "pay less than the blended rate" and would ensure a "stable  and cheaper supply" of electricity for these consumers.  SB 18X: Sen. Escutia said that SB 18X would essentially "re-regulate  electricity for small and core consumers that use less than 500 kW."  She  also referred to these consumers as "those who did not ask for deregulation  in 1996,"  but have had to suffer through the energy crisis caused by it.  SB  18X calls for "re-establishing cost-based rates...to stop the bleeding of the  utilities."  Consumers (businesses, homeowners, etc.) who use less than 500  kW would be bundled into a core customer group "like the gas companies do,"  and would have their electricity provided through a "core portfolio" of  generating assets owned by the utilities (to be purchased by the utilities  under permissions of the PUC).  Any power generated from these core assets  could not be directed to consumers who use more than 500 kW/day.  SB 17X (Brulte): This bill "encourages homeowners, developers and small to  mid-sized businesses to purchase and install solar energy systems" by  providing a tax credit toward the purchase and installation of these  systems.  Senator Brulte did not attend the press conference, but did issue a  statement saying," Building a system of conservation and generation is a step  that will play a significant role in ending California's energy shortage."  Paul Fenn of Local Power spoke in support of AB 48X.  Fenn said that  aggregation would cause "wholesalers to bid competitively" to provide power  to these large customer blocks.  He cited the examples of Massachusetts and  Ohio, where "community choice" is law.  He also spoke of 400,000 customers in  Ohio who recently aggregated their power and now are served by Green Mountain.  There was a good number of local TV outlets represented, but few print or  radio reporters.  NEWS CONFERENCE #2 11:30 a.m., SACRAMENTO _ Assembly Minority Leader Bill Campbell holds press  conference regarding governor's support of buying transmission line bill,  state Capitol room 3016. Contact: Jamie Fisfis 319-2071.  The Bill Campbell/Republican press conference was very straight-forward and  presented one main theme: "a buyout of utility transmission assets is really  just another form of bailout." It was a press conference meant to keep the  pressure on the Governor. No materials handed out.

__label__1 Mark and Jeff,  The Paper & Pulp desk has a customer that they would like to put into a three  year financial deal; however, the credit profile of the customer would  require hefty upfront security.  At the same time, they would like to enter  into a contract wherein ENA purchases all of their production (newsprint) at  index prices.  ENA's payable to this company could run to 10MM/ month.  Can  we draft a netting arrangement that would allow us to net the physical and  financial exposures in the event of a default so that the customer would not  be required to post security for the financial deal?  I think we may have  done something along these lines for a couple of Fred Lagrasta's customers.   I am comfortable that the purchase payable will more than offset the  potential financial exposure, but want to ensure that you are comfortable  that the ability to net these two exposures can be assured through a  contract.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks, Tanya

__label__1 We had very successful media briefings in the US last week for Enron Credit. Overall, the meetings and site demos were a huge success and all of the  reporters seemed to genuinely benefit from the site demo of Enron Credit.  Below is a quick recap of John Sherriff's and Jeff Kinneman's media briefing schedules, as well as some additional notes and an article resulting from one of the demos.   John Sherriff held briefings with reporters from the following publications:  DerivativesWeek Dow Jones Fortune Magazine Bondweek Investor's Business Daily Financial Times BusinessWeek  Jeff Kinneman held briefings with reporters from the following publications:  Risk Magazine Institutional Investor Wall Street & Technology Derivatives Strategy Pensions & Investments Power Finance & Risk   We are already beginning to see results based on the demos.  As you know, Dow  Jones wrote a story on Enron Credit following the site demo; the article appeared on April 4, 2001. It is pasted below for your review. CFO.com also ran a story  on Enron Credit last week. In the next few weeks we expect to see stories in Bondweek, BusinessWeek, DerivativesWeek and Derivatives Strategy.  I will keep you posted on the European Briefings as well.  Thanks- Meredith   Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product By Christina Cheddar  08:15 ET Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  (This report was originally published late Wednesday.)  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise, knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more important. For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping track of credit risk has always been part of doing business. That became even more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based commodities trading network. In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders manage the credit risk. Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited basis. Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope. Last month, the company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format. Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known as the "Enron cost of credit ." The rating is expressed as an interest rate.  The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy and other related information. While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has turned the product into a new revenue stream. Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for a fee. The site also can sell a user a "digital bankruptcy swap," which is a way to hedge against credit exposure. The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against. For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately. According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity.  The tool is important because "in just a short amount of time, a company's credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight." At present, some analysts haven't factored in revenue from Enron Credit into their earnings models. However, as the commodity markets Enron trades in mature, it is possible the need for products such as Enron Credit could increase. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com

__label__11 Thanks for the story!  Have an all day meeting today, and my grandparents are going back to Maryland.  I did get a pair of pj's for Meaghan at Gymboree - the red ones with the little pique heart design.  Hope you did not get them too!  Bonnie Hitschel  210-283-2456        Subject: FW: No truer words were ever spoken      A man asked his wife what she'd like for her birthday.   "I'd love to be six again," she replied.   On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off  they went to a local theme park.  What a day!  He put her on every  ride in the park:  the Death Slide, the Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear-  everything there was!  Wow!  Five hours later she staggered out of the  theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.   Right to a  McDonald's they went, where he husband ordered a Big Mac for her along  with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake.  Then it was off to a  movie - the latest Star Wars!   What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband  and collapsed into bed.   He leaned over and lovingly asked, "Well, dear; what was it like being  six again?"   One eye opened, "You idiot, I meant my dress size."   The moral of this story is:  If a woman speaks and a man is there to  hear her, he will get it wrong anyway.

I like your suggestions and suggest the following enhancements:  We should integrate this solution into the CPUC process. ie Keep rate freez e  in effect until the Mar 02.  Make state agency take over as ESP to all  bundled customers at 110% of frozen rate.  This solution keeps the current   Rate Freeze in place and keeps us in the game to not lose our negative ctc.   It also corresponds to your minimal changes goal.  It also puts government   agency in the same place as us in having exposure to negative ctc as us.  I t  also accomodates the problem of RFP's taking longer than expected.  It also   solves the liquidity problem immediately and avoids the need for  forbearance.  And furthermore it keeps the utility exposed to bankruptcy  which minimizes their negotiating power.  I don't understand how this proposal addreses what happens with the existin g  assets of PG&E.  The worry I have is that PG&E gets to keep 50% of the  benefits of nuclear sales and 10% of the benefits of hydro sales, post rate   freeze.  If we damage 1890, the utilities are now in the drivers seat.  re "ESPs should be able to buy from UDCs at the current weighted average  generation rate from 1/1/01 =01) 12/31/02 to serve any competitive load in   California"  This suggest a replacement to AB 1890 which suggests significa nt  changes.  Would it not be better to say "After the rate freeze, the  government entity would take over the obligations of PG&E and continue them   to the end of 2002.  Such assumption and continuation, would be combined wi th  the government entity recieving the benefits of  the difference between  market prices and embedded costs of the SCE/PG&E existing generation assets .   Summary of Solution that incorporates these suggestions  Government entity becomes an ESP taking over all customers not served by  another ESP.  Government accepts any ESP's that come back within 3 weeks.  Utilities stopped from selling any additional nuclear, hydro, thermal or QF   generation. (requires change in legislation)  Utilities provide surcharge/credit, for the lessor of 40 years or retiremen t,  based on the difference between generation COS and market value to all ESPs ,  after rate freeze ends (requires change in legislation and settlement).  Government entity, as ESP,  charges Frozen Rate plus 10% until the end of   2002.  Government entity, assures all ESP that they will their costs will not exce ed  110% of frozen rate until the end of 2002.  Rate freeze and surcharge continue until the end of March 2002.  Any shortfall of agency would be recovered through a amortization over the   next 15 years with securitization less positive proceeds from auctioning  default provider.

My strategy was solve the immediate problem of solvency quickl y  by getting the government to step in while the rules of the RFP are defined ,  then do the auction, but if you think we could go straight to an RFP for  standard offer without going bankrupt, I would be for it.   I believe that we do not have time for an RFP (6 months) so that we should   get the government entity to step in to give us the time.   And auction by rate class would be good but noone would want the large  classes because their rate increase will be higher and they will be less  likely to stay.   Scott      cc: Don Black/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron  Subject: Re: Treasury (keep PG&E) Solvent Strategy    What about something different?   If we asked for an Auction by rate class that would allow a different compa ny  to market the default service.  The competitive bids would be used to reduc e  the overall undercollection.

Please keep in mind that my knowlege of MAPP's  transmission charges are limited to what I have been told or read and if  someone at MAPP has any additional information that would be helpful, they  should respond or perhaps you could address your questions to them.  It appears that you may be confusing MAPP's "scheduling" fee with the S/D fee  for the CA's - it is confusing that they call their's a scheduling fee also  and there's two of them.  The CA's didn't charge their S/D fee in the past as  that was the practice, but also MAPP was in the past telling CA's that they  should/could NOT charge their S/D fee also.  I believe that it was for  simplicity, based on the assumption that if no one charged that would be the  same if all charged, as we were all members.    Clearly the language in Sched  F now indicates that the transmission customer will pay MAPP's "Scheduling  and Tariff Administration" fee and also the CA's S/D fee.  The following is an excerpt from MAPP tariff found on their Home page:  Ancillary Services are needed with transmission service to maintain  reliability within and among the Control Areas affected by the transmission  service.  The Contractor shall provide, and the Transmission Customer is  required to purchase under this Tariff, (i) Scheduling and Tariff  Administration and (ii) Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation  Sources.  In addition, the Transmission Customer shall schedule transmission  service directly with the applicable Transmission Provider, and shall be  subject to the Transmission Provider's charges for scheduling service, for  each Transmission Provider system in which (i) the Transmission Customer's  resource is located, (ii) the Transmission Customer's load is located, (iii)  power is scheduled into the MAPP Region, and (iv) power is scheduled to leave  the MAPP Region, provided that the Transmission Customer shall not be subject  to more than one scheduling charge for a single system. A Transmission Provider that is the local Control Area operator shall offer  to provide through its individual open-access transmission tariff (either  itself or through arrangements with other parties) the following Ancillary  Services to a Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission  Provider's Control Area (i) Regulation and Frequency Response, (ii) Energy  Imbalance, (iii) Operating Reserve - Spinning, and (iv) Operating Reserve -  Supplemental.  The Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission  System is required to acquire these Ancillary Services from the local Control  Area operator, from a third party, or by self-supply. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 list the Ancillary Services offered under this Tariff. 3.1 Scheduling and Tariff Administration Service:  The rates and/or  methodology are described in Schedule 1. 3.2 Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation Sources Service:  The  rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 2.  In regards to the examples that you have listed, it would be my opinion that  the act of reserving transmision does not result in a Scheduling and Dispatch  fee, it is the actual Scheduling of the energy which would incur the charge.   Transmission reserved but not scheduled on would not incur a charge.  If you  were to schedule energy on the examples you have given, then a S/D fee would  be charged against each of your examples..  If I can be of any more help, please let me know.  Thanks  Terry>> <John_Olsen@wr.com> 11/01/00 04:05PM >>>  Terry,  Excuse me for my ignorance but it is my understanding that the original MAPP F rate included scheduling fees when transacting between MAPP members. With MAPP F being extended to the border company's interconnects, again it was my understanding that the border company would charge their scheduling fee for any schedule that left/entered their control area as part of a MAPP F request.  So that I am clear on what you are planning to do, could you please tell me what charges WAPA would assess for the following examples.  1.  WR reserves transmission from OAHE to ShercoGen using MAPP F. 2.  WR reserves transmission from OAHE to KCPL.WR using MAPP F. 3.  WR reserves transmission from MILESCITY TO KCPL.WR using MAPP F.  Thank you in advance for clearing this issue up for me.

As you will recall, WAPA originally administered it's own tariff and transmission was purchased directly from WAPA for all of our constrained paths.  There wasn't a separate Scheduling and Dispatch fee assessed for transmission purchased under the WAPA tariff, as this fee was built into the transmission rate.  We posted ATC's for all of our constrained paths (Miles City, SPC, SWPA (now AECI)) and MAPP Schedule F was not offered for energy transfers into or out of the MAPP area.  WAPA did not charge a Scheduling and Dispatch fee for transmission purchased under MAPP Schedule F, because it was not a common practice by any of the MAPP members to do so.  A FERC ruling required MAPP  to offer  MAPP Schedule F to Members and non-members alike, and to eventually open up the use of MAPP F from border to border, without the requirement to purchase transmission from the border company. These were major changes, and they occurred in steps, with MAPP initially offering service schedule F to everyone, then offering Service Schedule F rates or the border company tariff across the constrained interfaces, and finally using service schedule F for all transmission into, out of, or through MAPP, if less than 2 years in duration. During the transition, WAPA was still responsible for posting the constrained interfaces, monitoring the flows and re-posting when required.   We charged our Scheduling and Dispatch fee for all requests that used service Schedule F to transition across the constrained interfaces, and continue to do so today. Now the system has evolved where anyone can purchase MAPP schedule F and MAPP F can be utilized to transfer e! nergy into, across and out of the entire MAPP member system.  WAPA no longer administers the constrained interfaces for short term transactions and MAPP as the transmission provider is responsible for approving all transmission requests (less then 2 years).  When that change took place, MAPP was approached and asked to include the S/D fee as part of the MAPP Schedule F service Fee but MAPP was unwilling to take on this responsibility.  WAPA management therefore made the decision to start separately charging a Scheduling and Dispatch fee for all service Schedule F utilizing our transmission.  This was initially delayed, until we were able to develop  the software necessary to implement a billing program automatically..   If the software and programming had been available earlier, WAPA would have assessed the fee earlier.  Now the programming is in place and the decision was made to proceed. I hope this answers your question.  Yes, we have always charged the S/D fee for MAPP Schedule F transactions across our constrained interfaces but have now expanded this fee to include all MAPP Schedule F OASIS requests into, out of , or through our system whether they cross a constrained interface or not.  The fee is per OASIS request per day and the fee is assessed to the purchaser of the transmission.  If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or Email.

__label__1 Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item (2) ISO Systems &  Procedures:  At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today, there was  considerable discussion on how this Task Force (which was formed before the  OASIS ANOPR was posted) would coordinate on an industry-wide basis, a NERC  response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR.  Here are some important points a FERC Staff member (Marv Rosenberg) made at  the meeting.  These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal  and the process of getting buy-in in each of the Regions/RTOs.  -  FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing.   -  The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order 2000 together with new OASIS II  requirements -  Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals.   However a diversity of filings will indicate   non-consensus and FERC will  make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly.  FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices  standards for issuing in a NOPR.  FERC is looking for: - more functionality and to be more user-friendly - electronic scheduling - electronic reservations - reduce duplication of information entry for customers - not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications  I asked Marv to clarify this - He explained that although not required, FERC  welcomes propsals to address the control area   source/sink issues as part of  an OASIS II solution (ie Entergy Source/Sink Order)  OASIS II should: - continue use of Web browsers -  use templates for file transfers (uploads and downloads) - all displays do not have to look the same - but encourages a common look  and feel - within a RTO, business practicese may differ, but between RTOs the  practices must be standardized  We need to keep close to the NERC efforts since FERC has historically tended  to favor NERC proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus.    The clarificaton to the ANOPR given by Marv should make buy-in an important  element of our proposal. If FERC adopts the NERC filing, we will likely be stuck with the exisiting  contract path seams problems and LMP fragmentation in the East because NERC  is not proposing any tariff changes.  Also we will not get the control area  source/sink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at NERC in  7 months.  Of course, another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this Task  Force.

I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today.  I think that  the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for  transmission pricing and energy markets.  2. To make more clear about the Regional Plans, I think that we need to  consider the following.  A. BACKGROUND  Timelines of Current Process Current Players & Current Positions Allies  Key Issues now facing the process  B. MOVING FORWARD  Top Issues upcoming External Factors (e.g., will Entergy join SPP) Resource Needs Relationship to Commercial Objectives / Business Plans  C. OTHER ISSUES / CONCLUSION  I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans.  The key idea is  that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and  what issues need to be addressed.  Don't be shy about adding other topics and  issues.  We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the  commercial people.  I don't expect this to be easy, but I think that it will  be helpful.  3. I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure.  This  would entail developing four things (1) a tariff, (2) ISO Systems &  Procedures, (3) Day Ahead PX Energy Market, (4) Transmission Flowgate PX  Market.  These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace.  My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using  "off the shelf" material.  I know that Tom Delaney has already started  working on a tariff.  I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point 3.   We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point 4.  On the ISO, maybe  we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope / Work Plan and fees on setting  up an ISO (including costs of operation over time).  It would make sense to  me to do this very formally (including setting energy market zones and  defining the commercially significant Flowgates).  I would use the MISO as  the market to focus on, but am willing to listen to other thoughts.  Please let me know what everyone thinks.  Jim

__label__9 National Journal's CongressDaily Issue date:  June 7, 2001 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  TRADE Presidential Negotiating Authority A Must, Evans Says Top administration officials suggested today they are stepping up their push for presidential trade negotiating authority, rejecting suggestions by Finance Chairman Baucus that the bill may not move this year and showing flexibility on the controversial Jordan free trade agreement, which is backed by some key Democrats. Presidential trade negotiating authority is "number one on my list of issues [that] I am focusing on right now," Commerce Secretary Evans told a small group of reporters. Evans said he was surprised that Baucus had reportedly said the bill could "slip" into next year. Evans and a senior administration official also in on the session insisted that the bill must pass this year. They indicated not only was the trade negotiating authority needed to help move negotiations along with Chile and for a Free Trade Area of the Americas, but passage would help bolster U.S. credibility as it tries to launch a new trade round. Evans pledged he would aggressively argue for free trade to the American people and that President Bush would be touting it as well. Evans also said the point of this week's announcement that the United States would investigate limiting steel imports under section 201 of U.S. trade law was to see whether the steel industry needed help, but he noted that if the move made Democrats more comfortable backing trade negotiating authority, then all the better. The senior official indicated the administration was considering allowing the Jordan trade deal to maintain provisions that could lead to enforcement of its labor and environmental provisions with sanctions. The bill is supported by some Democrats who want a tougher line on these issues. Some business officials oppose the deal; others are not taking a position. "I think we are all coming around to the conclusion that ... one size does not fit all," the official said. "There's a lot of debate about whether Jordan's going to provide a way forward. I think it's a model. I don't think it is necessarily the model." But he added, "I think there's a number of different ways to approach the problem, and Jordan's one of them." And he compared Jordan's provisions to a portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. - by Keith Koffler -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  TAXES Gephardt Promises Offsets For Any Further Tax Cuts House Minority Leader Gephardt pledged today that Democrats will resist any move to pay for additional tax cuts this year with Medicare and Social Security trust fund money, but echoed Senate Majority Leader Daschle's comments Wednesday that there would be offsets for any additional tax relief that might be on the way this year. At a news conference criticizing the $1.35 trillion tax cut that became law today, Gephardt and other Democratic leaders acknowledged that energy-related tax cuts and renewal of a group of tax credits that expire this year are just some of the items Congress may need to address. Noting that GOP appropriators have already signaled they need more money for FY02 appropriations bills, Gephardt said it will be hard for Democrats and Republicans to advocate additional spending or tax relief, but added: "We will have offsets. We hope the Republicans will do the same." For now, he could offer no specific ideas on what the offsets would be, but he left the door open to even looking at the newly enacted tax bill as a source of funds. Daschle also said it was likely that future Congresses may need to modify the 10-year bill President Bush signed today in order to keep the budget balanced, but played down the notion such revisions could happen as early as this year. Ways and Means ranking member Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said the real impact of the tax cut is 10 years away, and claimed that [President] "George W. is saying, 'Not on my watch.'" The question of what tax measures could come next prompted a letter from Rangel to Ways and Means Chairman Thomas. Sources said Rangel learned this week that GOP leaders were considering trying to move a patients' rights bill quickly - even if it meant having the bill go right to the floor. There may have also been discussions about similarly speedy treatment for an energy- related tax break measure. But Rangel and Ways and Means Health Subcommittee ranking member Fortney (Pete) Stark, D-Calif., wrote Thomas today "to express our strong opposition to such an effort, and hope that you will join us in defending the jurisdiction and rights of the committee to act in this legislative arena.? you know, the Health Subcommittee already has had one hearing this year on this important topic." Meanwhile, GOP leaders are apparently eyeing a number of other priorities. House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma renewed his call for expanding tax deductions for charitable contributions in his statement greeting Bush's signature of the tax cut bill. Majority Leader Armey has said more tax relief should be on the way, but he acknowledged it could be modest. - by Stephen Norton -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  TAXES Bush Signs $1.35 Trillion, 10-Year Tax Cut Measure Surrounded in the ornate East Room by a crowd comprised mostly of elite Republican lawmakers, President Bush today signed into law the $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax relief package. The legislation, which largely takes its cue from Bush's signature campaign proposal, was hailed by Bush as a historic achievement ranking with tax reduction bills signed by former Presidents Kennedy and Reagan. Bush praised the role of some of the handful of Democrats on hand - including Senate Finance Chairman Baucus and Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia. "Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in Washington," Bush said. Calling this "an era of steady cooperation," Bush predicted, "more achievements are ahead." But few Democrats showed up to witness this particular moment of the new era. Among them were Sens. Max Cleland of Georgia, Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Reps. Ralph Hall of Texas, Ken Lucas of Kentucky and Bud Cramer of Alabama. Republican leaders such as House Speaker Hastert, Senate Minority Leader Lott, House Majority Leader Armey, Senate Minority Whip Nickles, House Majority Whip DeLay, House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas and Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, were more typical of those attending the bill-signing ceremony. Senior Senate Republicans declared afterward that one of their top priorities this summer will be to make the tax cut, which expires in a decade, permanent. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas vowed to aggressively move the legislation as an amendment. "The first thing we [have] got to do is make this [tax cut] permanent," Gramm told CongressDaily. "I intend to offer it at least a dozen times." Nickles said Republicans will "be successful in either extending the rate reduction or extending the zero bracket for estate taxes, I think," but he acknowledged, "It's going to be a challenge." Nickles added that he still will try to reduce the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 15 percent, to provide tax breaks for unemployed and those lacking employer assistance to buy health insurance, and add tax cuts to the minimum wage bill. Other tax cut vehicles, he said, could be the "Patients' Bill of Rights" and the tax extenders bill. On managed care reform, Nickles said, "there are some discussions going on, but I wouldn't try to claim any optimism" about a deal. - by Keith Koffler -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  HEALTH Senate Readies For Debate On Patients' Rights Proposal With the Senate still mired in debate over the education bill, behind-the-scenes discussions are picking up on what is expected to be the chamber's next order of business - debate on a managed care "Patients' Bill of Rights." HHS Secretary Thompson was on Capitol Hill today to meet separately with Senate Democratic and GOP leaders to discuss a potential compromise on an issue whose differences have thus far proved unbridgeable. President Bush earlier this spring vowed to veto the bill Democrats intend to bring to the floor - sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy. And Bush has endorsed a competing bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., John Breaux, D-La., and James Jeffords, I-Vt. At the same time, Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who helped write the McCain-Edwards- Kennedy bill - but deferred sponsorship while he sought to negotiate with the White House - is continuing his efforts, but signaled he will not wait much longer. After one of his meetings today, Thompson tried to strike a conciliatory tone. "We hope we're able to reach an agreement," he said, but added that "if the president feels strongly and this bill doesn't reach his principles, he will" veto it. Meanwhile, backers of the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords approach said new estimates from CBO show that their bill should represent the final compromise. According to CBO, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill would, when fully phased in, raise health insurance premiums by an estimated 2.9 percent. That compares to 4.2 percent for the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, and 2 percent for the GOP-sponsored bill that passed the Senate in 1999. "Today's CBO report illustrates what we've said all along, that our bill presents a true compromise on the 'Patients' Bill of Rights,'" said Frist. But the veto question appears the key to the upcoming debate. Backers of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy measure insist that the president will sign virtually any patients' rights bill Congress manages to pass. That prospect has frightened business and insurance lobbyists, who vehemently oppose provisions that would allow broad new rights to sue health plans in state and federal court. Administration officials Wednesday denied widespread speculation that Bush would soon issue a formal statement again threatening to veto the bill, but also left what one source called "wiggle room" if the Senate makes some, as yet undecided- upon, changes. While opponents of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy measure fear they lack the votes to defeat or even substantially change the measure - it appears to have virtually unanimous support among Democrats - save Breaux - as well as at least a handful of Republicans, including Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania - opponents are more confident about their ability to add to the measure a package of tax- related health insurance "access" provisions. Some of those, including a broad expansion of Medical Savings Accounts, could be controversial. - by Julie Rovner and April Fulton -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  SENATE LEADERSHIP Craig Predicts Senate Organizational Deal By Next Week Senate Republican and Democratic leaders are nearing agreement on a new organizational resolution for the Senate, although key senators predicted the issue would not be resolved until next week. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he hoped negotiators would be able to complete an agreement today. Sen. Pete Domenici, R- N.M., said Republicans were "purifying" their own proposals to decide how many points to include. Gramm and Domenici are part of a five-member GOP task force assigned by Minority Leader Lott to negotiate a new resolution with Majority Leader Daschle. Daschle said today negotiations were "going well," but declined to give details. The group is expected to meet again with Daschle today. But before any deal is final, Republicans will run any agreement that is reached by the entire GOP Conference - a requirement that led Republican Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho to predict a deal would not be finalized until mid-week. Republicans have backed down on their requirement that any new resolution include a mechanism to move presidential nominations to the floor. Instead, said a GOP aide, negotiators will assemble a memorandum or some sort of written statement, or a colloquy for leaders to deliver on the floor. Democrats, meanwhile, have given in to a GOP demand that committees be expanded to reflect a one-seat Democratic advantage, rather than bumping Republicans from panels. Said Commerce Chairman Hollings, "I'm not comfortable with it, but that's what it's going to be." Hollings' panel will grow to 23 members, a size he said will make it hard to hold efficient hearings. "You get through opening statements and, good God, the day is over," he said. - by Geoff Earle -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS Lieberman To Probe Decisions On Energy, Environment Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Lieberman today promised not to use his new chairmanship to "practice the politics of personal attacks and destruction," but said he will investigate the high cost of energy, as well as ask the Bush administration to explain its rescission of federal environmental standards. "The current high price of energy and shortages in energy supply in some parts of our country . will be the committee's immediate priority," Lieberman said in an agenda session with reporters. Lieberman has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday to look at the deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries and a June 20 hearing to consider whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has done enough to keep electricity prices reasonable. "From all that I have seen . I think FERC has the authority to act and should have acted already," Lieberman said. A cosponsor of price cap legislation proposed by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D- Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., Lieberman said he would not ordinarily favor price controls, but said the lack of competition in the Western energy market warrants them. Lieberman said he also wanted to know how Bush administration officials decided so quickly to roll back federal standards regulating arsenic, forest roadbuilding and mining waste. "Who did you talk to?" Lieberman asked rhetorically of the administration's rapid rollback of federal policy long in the making. He also said he would "put the breaks on any additional plans the White House has to roll back environmental standards." Lieberman said he had a good relationship with ranking member Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and said they would work together on issues such as reducing government waste and abuse, electronic government initiatives and attracting new and qualified federal personnel. As the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last year's disputed election, Lieberman was asked to clarify his vow not to use his committee for political retribution. "The difference between oversight and overkill is in the eye of the beholder, but you and I will know it once we see it," he said. When asked specifically about whether he would investigate Vice President Cheney's use of his official residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory for a political event, Lieberman said definitively no, but compared it to former President Clinton's White House coffees. "It did make me laugh because the event and the explanation of the event sounded very similar to what Republicans said" about the coffees, Lieberman said. - by Mark Wegner -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  ENVIRONMENT Interior Approps Panel Restores Bush Energy, Land Cuts The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee unanimously approved an $18.9 billion spending bill today that restores President Bush's proposed cuts in energy research and increases funding for energy conservation and land preservation initiatives, National Journal News Service reported. The measure provides $1.8 billion for energy programs, an increase of $294 million over the administration's request. The panel included $311 million for weatherization and state energy grants, which is an increase of $120 million over last year's level, and includes $940 million for overall energy conservation. Calling the restoration of energy conservation and research funding "crucial," given the nation's electricity woes, subcommittee ranking member Norman Dicks, D-Wash., hailed the panel's "very bipartisan effort" and dedication to conservation spending. "This is a good example of how we can cooperate and work on a bipartisan basis," he said. In addition to the increased energy funding, the subcommittee also agreed to provide $1.32 billion for the widely heralded land conservation initiative launched last year as a compromise to the controversial Conservation and Reinvestment Act. Although significantly smaller than CARA, the conservation initiative nonetheless represents a doubling of federal spending on a variety of resource conservation programs. The bill increases funding by $121 million over last year's level and $64 million over the administration's request. The program includes $100 million for state wildlife grants, $45 million for wetlands conservation, $47 million for historic preservation and $60 million in conservation incentives for private landowners. House Appropriations ranking member David Obey, D-Wis., said the increase in conservation funding keeps a commitment the Congress made to the compromise program last year when appropriators balked at CARA's 15-year budget commitment to land programs. "That should send a message to the administration that they ought to recognize a good deal when they see it," Obey said. Appropriations Chairman Young said he expected the full committee to mark up the Interior spending bill next Wednesday. - by Cyril Zaneski -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  EDUCATION GOP Criticizes Plan To Restrict 'Straight A's' Initiative Republicans today said an amendment to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act exempting one category of school funding from a trial program known as "Straight A's" would gut a major component of the president's education bill. The amendment to exempt 21st Century learning centers from the "Straight A's" pilot program would remove almost half of the available money and would discourage states from participating, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said. If the amendment passes, it would "certainly be a blow to the bipartisan coalition that has worked on this bill," said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. The "Straight A's" program was taken out of the bill on the House side, so Frist said it was essential the provision stay in the Senate bill when the bills go to conference. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who is sponsoring the amendment, said he still plans to move forward on it. Meanwhile, the Senate set aside another Dodd amendment today after Republicans threatened a filibuster, delaying a potentially explosive vote which Republicans said goes to the heart of whether Congress wants federal or local control over schools. The amendment would require states to "achieve comparability of education opportunities" among their schools, and was watered down from earlier, more specific language. "This is not radical, this is common sense," Dodd said during floor debate. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy said the amendment does not interfere with the president's initiative and encourages states to provide "additional focus and attention on poor and underprivileged children." But Collins said it was an "attempt by the federal government to set national standards." - by April Fulton -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  SCHEDULE Senate To Work Through Amendments On Education Next Week The Senate next week will work through amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization bill. Majority Leader Daschle said votes are expected Monday, and that he intends to finish the bill by the end of the week. The House will return next week Tuesday for a series of suspension votes after 6 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House is scheduled to take up the Sudan Peace Act and the SEC fees reduction bill, although the latter bill has been postponed several times. No House votes are expected Friday. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  POLITICS Jackson Meets With Lawmakers To Discuss Electoral Reform, Other Issues Rev. Jesse Jackson was on Capitol Hill today meeting with Senate Majority Leader Daschle, and Sens. Christopher Dodd, D- Conn., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., to discuss electoral reform and other issues, including judicial nominations. "I'm sure hearings on electoral reform will begin this summer," Jackson said, citing a report to be formally released by the Civil Rights Commission Friday showing that minority voters in Florida were overwhelmingly "disenfranchised." A draft of that proposed report leaked out earlier this week, prompting criticism from Republicans that it was inspired by partisanship. The commission consists of four Democrats, three independents and one Republican. Jackson said, "We must even the playing field for certain voters." Jackson also said he was taking another trip to South Africa to deal with the spread of AIDS in that country. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  POLITICS Stenholm Expects Mark Up Of Emergency Aid To Farmers Next Week House Agriculture ranking member Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, told reporters today he expects the House Agriculture Committee to mark up emergency aid to farmers for this crop year next week. Stenholm also said the amount of aid for this year might be higher than $5.5 billion in the FY02 budget resolution. That money would come from a $79 billion, multi-year pool of funds created to increase agricultural spending. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  POLITICS Daschle PAC To Hold Annual Gala DASHPAC, the leadership PAC of newly minted Senate Majority Leader Daschle, could not have picked a better time - fundraising wise - to schedule its annual Washington bash than this evening. Sources said the DASHPAC gala, which is being held at the 701 restaurant, is expected to pull in over $1 million and possibly break the PAC's previous record. Tickets to tonight's gala are going for $1,000 per individual, $5,000 per PAC or $10,000 for corporate donors: the PAC has a $10,000 limit for contributors. On K Street, lots of heavy lifting has been done by several blue chip lobbyists, including Joel Jankowsky of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; former Daschle staffer Rita Lewis of The Washington Group; and former Texas Gov. Ann Richards of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhand, McPherson & Hand. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  POLITICS Poll Finds Smith, Shaheen Tied A new American Research Group poll shows Sen. Bob Smith, R- N.H., in a statistical tie with Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, but it also shows GOP Rep. John Sununu leading Shaheen by double digits in a trial heat of the 2002 election. The poll, conducted last Friday through Monday of 558 registered voters with a 4.26 point error margin, shows Smith leading Shaheen 42-41 percent, with 17 percent undecided. But Sununu leads Shaheen 51-35 percent, with 14 percent undecided. Sununu has been contemplating a challenge to Smith, who briefly left the Republican Party in 1999 during his unsuccessful presidential campaign, and the Manchester Union-Leader reported today that many state Republicans believe that Sununu has passed the point of no return and will indeed challenge Smith in the GOP primary. However, a recent invitation Sununu sent out for a June 10 fundraiser headlined by former President Bush talks about a House re- election campaign. In the letter, which refers to his 2000 Democratic challenger Martha Fuller Clark, Sununu wrote: "We had a hard fought campaign last year. ... in less than six months time, my opponent spent over $1 million ... already, she has announced her candidacy for 2002. Our campaign next year will be at least as tough, if not tougher." Sununu can transfer the money to a Senate campaign if he decides to enter that race. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  TRANSPORTATION Airlines Offer More Voluntary Commitments To Improve Customer Services In an apparent effort to stave off potentially onerous passengers' rights legislation, the airlines announced today they are beefing up their voluntary commitments to improve customer services and also are making those commitments legally enforceable by including them in their customer contracts. House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young and Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., applauded the industry's latest commitment, saying airlines should not bear sole blame for air travel delays. Citing weather difficulties as the leading cause of delay, Young and Mica also singled out local opposition to runway construction as a factor in air congestion and delay. Fairly narrow passengers' rights legislation pending in the Senate would strengthen the government's hand in holding the airline industry to better standards and was expected to come to the floor for a vote in that chamber. Among the airlines' latest commitments, are pledges to offer the lowest fare available on the telephone reservation system, to notify passengers of known delays, cancellations and diversions and to meet passengers "essential needs" during long on-aircraft delays. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  AGRICULTURE Veneman Defends Her Undersecretary Choice Agriculture Secretary Veneman defended a nominee for a top position at her department against allegations he was insensitive to minorities and favored corporate farm interests, the Associated Press reported. Veneman, speaking to reporters after a ceremony honoring former Agriculture Secretary Glickman, called Thomas Dorr, an Iowa farmer picked to be undersecretary for rural development, a "visionary thinker." Dorr's nomination has been criticized by groups representing minority farmers and small- scale farming interests. At Iowa State University in 1999, Dorr observed that an economically prosperous area of his state lacked ethnic and religious diversity. He also has suggested the creation of giant farming operations in which individual farmers would work together. The Senate Agriculture Committee has not scheduled a hearing on Dorr's nomination. Senate Agriculture Chairman Harkin has not taken a position on Dorr. In a recent letter to the committee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said they were shocked that a USDA nominee "would express the belief that ethnic diversity is an impediment to economic growth." -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  THE FINAL WORD "We both have a clear understanding of important issues - like endangered species. After all, he's a Democrat from Kansas and I'm a Republican from California." - Agriculture Secretary Veneman, speaking today at the formal unveiling of the official portrait of former Agriculture Secretary Glickman.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  CongressDaily is published daily, Monday through Friday, by National Journal Group Inc.

__label__8 Hey. I had a question I wanted to ask you. I know you talked about taking the extra $10,000 you got and investing it for me. I was wondering if you were still going to do that or if you just took it and paid David. Even if you could give me the $4,000 left over after paying him $6,000 it would help. I'm kinda in a jam right now (between you and I) and I have some stuff I need to pay. I still owe Jay $5,500 for my car that he put on a credit card, and I have $4,000 of it, but if I give it all to him, that leaves me pretty broke. $27,000 of my money is stuck in my loan with the credit union, I paid mom like $2,000, paid off my credit, and have been making 2 car payments and 2 insurance payments since I still have the Neon. Even if you can only give me the $4,000 or even half of that...anything would help. I didn't know if you were still keeping that $10,000 for me or not, if you're not let me know. If you weren't, maybe you could lend me some money and I can pay you back...I'll be at work all day so E-Mail me back and let me know OK? Thanks. I love you. Ang

Attached are two sets of draft amendment language that were discussed today consistent with a general strategy on the bill that was discussed yesterday.  That strategy, generally speaking, keys off an expected Calpine meeting with Hertzberg on Monday, and is as outlined again below.  Comments / concerns with language and/or general strategy should go to Julee for IEP by Monday COB for consideration in next steps as mentioned in the action items.  The anticipated approach with the Hertzberg will be:  A) Persuade him that the "California First!" notion as presented in this bill (and elsewhere) is not a good policy approach and that the bill should be killed because: it will be interpreted as protectionist by other states and will lead them to retailiate; it will isolate California from existing supplies elsewhere that could help serve California loads; it could deny CA access to new generation built in other states that could help CA; it will slow CA projects "in the pipeline"; it will undermine existing commercial arrangements that developers have _with_ California entities from CA projects in the pipeline, etc.  If this does not happen, then ...  B) Persuade him to change the bill into something else (as in carrot/incentive and not a stick that increases commercial and development risks);  if this does not work and he will consider alternate language which does not disrupt existing arrangements, then ...  C1) Take the more extensive "bulletproof" language, attached as "C1", which protects any existing commercial arrangements and provides a method to bring buyers and sellers together via a notice to interested purchasers maintained by the CEC;  if that does not work and he will consider alternate language on another approach which will not disrupt existing arrangements, then ...  C2) Take the "offer to negotiate" language, attached as version "C2", which was the language developed and circulated yesterday (with the addition of irrigation districts to the list of folks to whom the offer to negotiate is extended),  and if that doesn't work, then  D) he wants to disrupt existing commercial relationships and he wants to adopt a protectionist "California First!" policy which we cannot fix or support.

__label__11 Mark, I forgot to tell you that I made it out to see Sam last night and to  give her the contributions.  She was speechless as were the rest of her  family members there.  She said it gave her a lot of strength to know that so  many people care.  Sam lost a ton of weight but she is starting to eat  again.    I was talking to Tana today and Tana made a great suggestion that we get  together a small group to take her to lunch one day a few weeks before she  comes back to work.   Tana reminded me of a statement Sam made about  preferring to meet in small groups first rather than being overwhelmed by  lots of people.  So I think she might like meeting in a small group of folks  from work so that when she comes back its not the first time she sees  everyone.    Cheryl Nelson Senior Counsel EB3816 (713) 345-4693

__label__7 Today, we received a letter from FERC notifying us that they are initiating  an inquiry to increase "their understanding of the scope and development of  electronic trading in electric power and natural gas markets."   FERC is  requesting that EnronOnline "cooperate" with the inquiry.  The letter states  that they will be sending us a request for information, and visiting our  offices in Houston.    We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make  sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will  get back to you asap with further information.   Lisa Yoho Government Affairs

My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests,  Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've made a few small changes: Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea.  The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.  Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it is a turkey.  We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them.  They are lying. We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.  We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.   In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table.  In a separate room.  Next door.  Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.  I stress "private", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances, enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.  I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that "passing the rolls" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance.  Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it.   Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably won't come next year either.    I am thankful.

__label__3 Subject:	Program Changes   As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.  ?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.  We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

__label__7 Steve:  We need you to have a word with Senator Wyden about the transparency  legislation that I worked on with his office.  The bill is designed to  require transmission companies and generators to release operating data on a  real time basis.  Unfortunately, comments by Senator Wyden made at the FERC  nominee hearing left the impression that he is gunning for evil marketers,  including Enron.  Most importantly, that impression was left with McLane  Layton of Sen Nickles office who has been asked to support the bill.  Wyden  claims he was "misquoted".   Nonetheless, impress upon him that Enron is sticking its neck out on the  bill because other marketers and generators do not necessarily agree that  more information should be disclosed and that we are not eagre to lend our  support if this is going to be turned against us.  I have attached the bill language (it has not been introduced).

I'm not sure if you remember but we met at the press briefing that Mr. Skilling held at the National Press Building at the end of the summer here in Washington to discuss the California electricity markets. I am contacting you today in the hopes that I might be able to speak with you or someone else from Enron for a story I am working on for this week's issue concerning American natural gas marketers moving into Europe. I was hoping I could interview someone with the company before Thursday so that I could write the story before my Friday deadline. For the story, I am basically looking to do background, i.e. How is the European market different from the American market? Will the network business model translate well there? What kind of regulatory pitfalls do the companies' face? Will a liquid natural gas market develop in Europe? If so, what kind of timeline are we talking about? What is Enron's position and take on the whole European market? I would appreciate any time or guidance you might be able to give me on this subject. If you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate to call. Once again, thanks for your time.  Sincerely, Christian Schmollinger Staff Reporter, Natural Gas Week 1401 New York Ave., NW Suite 500 Washington, DC 20005 Ph. 202-662-0726 Fax 202-347-8089

Subject: SoCal RLS Tariff revision (will help So Trails)          Subject:    Kevin,  As a follow up to our recent discussions concerning the SoCalGas RLS or peaking rate, I am forwarding to you the proposed decision of ALJ Brown.  My understanding is that at yesterday's Commission meeting the Commission made a decision to approve a change to the current peaking rate tariff.  I should have their decision within a couple working days.  I am forwarding their draft decision.  The expected PD rate design for the new peaking rate would include SFV rate design principals, demand charges determined over highest recorded usage over a 12 month period, and inclusion of public purpose program charges.  At this point we'll call it a modified cost of service approach.  If you have any questions, please call.   Mark Baldwin
__label__1 Just an update... I spoke with V&E this morning and the sale has been put on  hold.  The negotiations broke down last week and, with the holiday, there has  been no further progress.

Current estimates indicate that the  loss on the sale will be around $30MM.  It is expected that the sale of the  one remaining South American LDC will result in gains that will more than  offset this loss.  Obviously, those expectations can change, but I wanted to  keep everyone informed on this.  Ryan - This expected realized loss is exactly the situation which most  concerned us in the meeting with Patti this week.  Is there anything we can  do to push them towards resolving that timing of realized losses is  irrelevent, and this is not an issue?

Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and  calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls  are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will  result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index  premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.  In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) -  which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index  -1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to  reflect the difference in strikes.

__label__1 Please see the attached for various suggestions - action items (in red)        Subject:RE: Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails   I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the wareho useman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requir es them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't  have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to dam ages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this  issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would  be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, b ut only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the w arehouseman's lien .  At this point it is probably better to get some gas a nd then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  [Zisman, Stua rt]  This sounds like the right way to go.  Joe Parks should visit with the appropriate person at Bridgeline to figure out how much gas they are willi ng to release and try to get it sold.  Stuart,  the answers to your questio ns are inserted below.        Subject:Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails   I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval proc ess  [Zisman, Stuart]  Gerald when you are able to figure out what must be  done please advise. will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns  #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.   Several interesting points from the meeting:   1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is t he last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Leas e - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligat ed to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following t he 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad  Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due  on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02.  [Zisman, Stuart]   The Bridgeline folks said something abo ut an August date and then adding 110 days to that and then adding 114 days to that.  Does that make any sense to you?   2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the  existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all cla ims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease ; This approach sounds reasonable.   3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167 k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt remove d fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This  is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leachin g operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify t heir numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during d egassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to underst and their basis for the claim.   [Zisman, Stuart]  Brian would you please c all Gary to find out what this is all about?   4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various righ ts-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know wha t the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input  along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until  July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to w rap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the  Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with owner ship of the cavern.  [Zisman, Stuart]    Is there any downside to doing it  early?  Might we lose negotiating leverage?  If not, we should consider try ing to do this as a good faith gesture.   5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximat ely 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agr eeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be d one no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable.   6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $5 50k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

__label__1 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK  PRODUCT  Nicole and Bob:  This will confirm our telephone conference today regarding the issue whether  Enron Metals should be sending out 180-day notice of contest letters to the  various carriers who have tried to collect unpaid freight from Enron Metals  as a result of the reported insolvency of ICTS, Enron Metals' former shipping  agent.  Bob advised that the carrier's claims he has received in the New York office  total in the neighborhood of $30,000-$35,000.  Of those, three carriers  apparently have claims of $5,400, $16,000 and $13,210.  With respect to those  three carriers, Bob's office has sent some type of letter indicating that  Enron Metals already paid ICTS for this shipment and that those carriers  should look to ICTS for payment.  The remaining claims are reportedly  relatively small (and Bob will be sending me his file containing those claims  shortly).  Nicole advised that the claims she has received in the Montreal office total  in the neighborhood of $40,000.  Close to 90% of those reportedly involve  shipments that were completed prior to the end of April.  It is Nicole's  understanding that she and her office were still a part of Barclay's until  the end of April.  She is not, however, aware of how responsibility would  have been apportioned between Barclay's and MG Metals at the time for claims  such as these.  Nicole will shortly send me an e-mail which sets forth what  bills concern shipments that occurred after the end of April.  No notice of  contest letter of any kind has been sent to these carriers.  Both of you indicated that the telephone calls you had been receiving from  the carriers has tapered off.  Based on the foregoing, I recommended to you, and you agreed, that the best  strategy was to "let sleeping dogs lie"--i.e., not to attract attention to  Enron Metals by sending out 180-day notice of contest letters to the various  carriers.  The risk here is that if one or more of these carriers does file  suit, you may not be able to assert any defense on behalf of MG Metals, such  as a late or inaccurate bill (and I have not researched your bills to  determine whether such defenses exist).  Should a carrier file suit, you  would probably be liable for the principle and interest, along with  attorneys' fees.    However, given our preliminary impression that MG Metals is secondarily  liable on these bills if ICTS defaults, and the relevatively small size of  most of these bills, I think a "reactive" rather than "proactive" defensive  strategy makes sense.   Nicole and I agreed that I would run down exactly how Barclay's and MG Metals  decided to apportion liability for charges such as these at the time of that  transaction.  By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Marcus if he knows the  right person to advise me on this (or if he has access to the relevant  documents).  I will continue to keep you advised.  Britt

The list for Australian weather is  fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral  requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we  do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These  are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not  linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading  Australian power and weather.

__label__1 what is an 82/82% percent deal?
__label__1 The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission m eeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence g athered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:   Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will requ ire sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  Al l California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, w ill be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of t heir use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric faciliti es will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr)   Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price  auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in t he ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a partici pating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be the avera ge daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions are t o be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and emissions will be pub lished the day after, for use on the following day.  A single market cleari ng price is determined in real time for all generators.  Highest bid sets t he clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with FERC and the IS O, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating uni t.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each gene rator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 da ys of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs in real  time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to justify  bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no oppo rtunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.   Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entiti es must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve. (24-7)    Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC.    Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.   RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June  1 or Order lapses with no further effect.   ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are d ue in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.   Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based ra te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withh old of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate b idding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the  generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be  inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited ( i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).   Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  Ref und conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a co ntrol area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when  this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be just ified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell c ontractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within  WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  Comme nts are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective dat e is 60 days from publication of the Order.   Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit  is prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fine s does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as pa rt of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generat ion would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining pr ice.    Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) wheth er FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an esc row account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have o n the PG&E bankruptcy filing.

__label__7 Andy:  In the spirit of "full disclosure", I thought I would let you know what ENA  has agreed to on the ISDA side with various Merrill entities. ENA has ISDA's with Merrill Lynch International Bank (8/25/95), Merrill Lynch  Capital Services Inc. (12/2/92) and Merrill Lynch International (8/25/95). There is no arbitration provision in any of these agreements; there is merely  silence as to jurisdiction (ENA began negotiating arbitration around 1997).   All of these agreements contain our standard limitation of liability language  (in boldface) and all permit some type of assignment to an affiliate (in  general, without negative tax impact or with sufficient credit support).  All  of the agreements provide for setoff (including affiliates of non-defaulting  parties) and all contain confidentiality provisions.  I would therefore propose the following changes to Annex I:  change the margin deadline time to 10:00 a.m. (NY time) delete Par 9(b) - and you can send your additional no custody required  language delete the arbitration provision in its entirety  I hope that you can resond to the remaining issues tomorrow morning so that  we can finalize docs by the afternoon.  Thanks for your assistance.  Sara

__label__1 Sara: Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all that  much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all  counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have  asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding  exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues  to cover on Friday involve:  1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard  langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to  whether NY or Texas law applies.  2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties.   For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a  list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree  with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.  3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.  I'm available anytime to talk about the above.  Carol

__label__1 Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:  1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.  2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.  3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.  4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.  Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.  Regards,  Stephanie          Subject:	Regulatory Updates - General Updates  Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures.   To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and "Hot Button" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.    I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.  regards,   Barry Tycholiz

__label__2 Attached, please find Governor Davis' press release describing his framework of a recovery plan.  In addition, the Governor made the following comments during his press conference.  He is currently negotiating with the IOUs.   He expects positive news next week, however, only two of the three IOUs are open to his plan at this point.  He did not indicate which IOU is holding out, but it has been widely reported that PG&E does not like his plan.  He has received informal signals from FERC that they are not adverse to state ownership of the grid.  He expects the "significant contribution" from the parent companies to exceed the previously reported tax refund.  He refused to give a projected price for the grid other then to say it would be some multiple of book.  His office has briefed both the Senate and Assembly Democrats.  He believes Democrats will reach agreement on a legislative package by the end of next week, and vote that package out by the end of the following week.  He continues to speak to generators, however he has not briefed them specifically on this plan.  He hopes this plan will provide assurances to generators that he is working towards a solution but he can not guarantee that the new IOU funds will cover existing debt.  He acknowledged that eminent domain would likely lead to a significant withdrawal of private capital and continues to believe his plan is feasible.  http://www.governor.ca.gov/state/govsite/gov_htmlprint.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@03 38296330.0982364405@@@@&BV_EngineID=halkdjlkkklbemfcfkmchcgi.0&sFilePath=%2fgo vsite%2fpress_release%2f2001_02%2f20010216_PR01057_utility_recovery_plan.html& sTitle=GOVERNOR+DAVIS+ANNOUNCES+%0aRECOVERY+PLAN+FOR+STATE'S+UTILITIES%0a&sCat Title=Press+Release&iOID=13379

Please see his e mail. ---------------------- Forwarded by Elizabeth L Hernandez/HOU/ECT on  12/05/2000 03:08 PM ---------------------------        cc:   Subject: Consumers Energy  Elizabeth,  Can you check out Deal #'s 411921 (Sale) and 411937 (Purchase)?  Looks like a  buy/sell where we sold to Consumers Energy in October (1,000,000 total at  5.20) and bought it back from them in November.  Both deals have 0 rates so  that's not a problem.  The problem is - there's an exchange fee on both deals  of $0.0725.  But it's a negative fee on the sales side and a positive fee on  the purchase side.  That means I would owe them a netted amount of $145,000.   Is that right??  Should the sale side maybe be positive so the two sides net  to 0 - or do we owe them this money?? Also, the confirmation letter for the sales side mentions a "spread fee" to  be paid by Seller (ENA) of $155,000.  Could that $145,000 netted amount be a  part of that?  And if so, where's the other $10,000?  So many questions!!  I have copies of the confirms if you need to see them.   Let me know...  ...Chuck

The list for Australian weather is  fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral  requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we  do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These  are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not  linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading  Australian power and weather.  Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and  weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to  trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to  check this one out further.

__label__12 If you haven't voted already, I urge you to vote now for ANDREW STRONG of Houston for President-Elect of the Texas Young Lawyers Association (TYLA). Your ballot should have arrived from the State Bar earlier last week.  Don't let that ballot just sit in your in-box!! Andrew has devoted himself to working with children and young-adults in Houston throughout the state. He sincerely believes in community service, and as our President, I believe that Andrew will work hard to promote assistance and programs for the less fortunate.  In addition to his professional accomplishments and his civic works, ANDREW is truly a good guy.  He is deserving of our support and our votes.  It is very important that you return your ballot, especially since ANDREW is running against a Dallas opponent.  In the past TYLA elections, less than 25% of the eligible voters returned their ballots. These statewide races are usually won by margins of 200 to 300 votes. Please vote for ANDREW STRONG and encourage your friends to do the same.  No stamp is required!  The ballots must be received in the State Bar office by April 30th.  Please check out ANDREW's brochure that lists his numerous accomplishments and awards that is provided with ballot. If you have any questions, please contact me at your earliest convenience.  Thanks for your support!  Jim

Can you believe that I had been on the 30th floor since the  summer of 1994?!  I know that sets some kind of record at Enron!!  It is kind  of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations  has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so  many others.    My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will  be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for  an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she  starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is  "two and a half".  What a delight he continues to be!!    I know that Erin has worked hard.  I hope that she and her husband are doing  well.  --Sally         08/08/2000 08:51 AM	       cc:   Subject: excitement  Sally --  I acted impulsively when I saw you this a.m.  I was so excited to know you  were on the 33rd floor where I was picking up United Way shirts that I didn't  control my enthusiasm over seeing you.  I apologize if I disrupted you.  Griff  P.S.  I hope your family is doing fine.  Erin graduates in December from  UT-Dallas with her masters in Speech Path.  She and her husband are doing  very well and very much in love.

__label__1 The following is a press release from Assembly Member Ellen Corbett  regarding her new windfall profits tax bill ABX 128 which will probably  be heard in committee following the Easter break.       For Immediate  Release  Contact:    Rebecca Nieto  April 4,  2001  (916) 319-2018     Corbett Introduces Windfall Profits Tax Measure    SACRAMENTO =01) Responding to increasing electricity rates and the  continuing threat of rolling blackouts, Assembly Revenue and Taxation  Committee Chair Ellen Corbett (D-San Leandro) today introduced a  windfall profits tax measure intended to help restore sanity to the  pricing of electricity in California.  The bill, AB 128X, imposes an  electrical power generation windfall profits tax on the windfall profits  realized by power generators, their affiliates, and the middlemen who  participate in California's energy market. However, in recognition of  the fact that some generators are cooperatively working with the state  by holding their costs down, the measure is targeted at generators whose  gross receipts significantly exceed the cost these entities incur to  produce the energy they sell.   "We cannot continue to pay the exorbitant rates that are currently being  charged in today's marketplace.  Consumers and small businesses are  seeing their energy rates skyrocket.  The state is spending $45 million  per day to help meet demand.  We are looking toward a summer of rolling  blackouts.  Yet, we continue to allow some electricity generators and  middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into  the state.  This profiteering must stop, and AB 128X will help us ensure  that it does."   The windfall profits tax measure imposes an add-on tax equal to a set  percentage of the gross receipts derived from the sale of electrical  power into the state. The measure also targets middlemen who have been  able to game the electricity market by buying up supply and reselling it  at much higher rates.  AB 128X hits these middlemen by taxing the  receipts they realize from excessively high markups.   "As Chair of a working group charged with developing a windfall profits  tax, I look forward to working with my colleagues on moving this measure  through the Legislature."
__label__1 Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.    In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."  He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Subscribe and unsubscribe information  can be found at the bottom of this newsletter.   **************************** November 28, 2000  ************************   If you were one of the millions who dealt with the crowds during  Thanksgiving travel, you may be ready for another vacation. If that's the  case, you don't want to miss out on our $158 roundtrip coast-to-coast  super sale (travel through March 1) or our 50 percent off Caribbean sale  (travel through June 15, including the peak winter season). With cold  weather settling in across many parts of the country, 85-degree beaches  and a tall tropical drink sipped under a warming sun sounds pretty good.  If sunshine and beaches are not your cup of Long Island Tea, pick the spot  that hits your fancy and fly between over 58 U.S. cities coast-to-coast  for only $158-198 through March 28 (Florida travel is valid through March  14). As an added plus, check an offer that can make you an elite-level  frequent flyer with just one trip. Most frequent flyers have to rack up a  minimum of 25,000 airmiles to hit the first level of elite status, but we  can tell you how to do it quick and easy. We're posting many other goodies  on our News Desk by the hour. Add it to your bookmarks and visit regularly  to be among the first to know what's up in low fares.   COAST-TO-COAST FROM $158 THROUGH MARCH 1, 2001  Just in time for the holidays, we have coast-to-coast airfares as low as  $158 roundtrip. Chances are, we have the route you need. Please be aware  that travel to Florida will be almost impossible December 18-29 for those  who have not already purchased. Even First Class is almost completely sold  out. That leaves the rest of the country at your disposal on Bestfares.com  bargain fares, or you can book Florida for a welcome post-holiday stay.  We'll even waive that ferocious $40 fuel surcharge to add to your savings.  For example, travel to and from the West Coast--Los Angeles, San  Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle or Portland--to Baltimore,  Hartford, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Houston and many more  cities for just $158 roundtrip. From the West Coast to Dallas, Minneapolis  or Milwaukee is just $190. From the West Coast to Boston, New York City,  Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Miami is only $238. Don't miss out on  these holiday and winter fares. Go home for the holidays (or relax  afterward) on these tempting fares. Visit  http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898.   LAST 4 DAYS: $198 RT BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES THROUGH MARCH 31  If we don't have the coast-to-coast sale fare you need in one category,  we'll try another. This one requires fast action, with just four days left  to book, but it gives you an extra month of travel (March 1-31) plus  another bucket of fares to draw from. Business travelers face walk-up fare  increases of as much as $370, added since the first of the year. Leisure  travelers can use this sale to fly for slightly more than half of what  business travelers are paying in fare hikes alone. If you live in Seattle,  Portland (OR), Reno, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix or Los  Angeles, head east to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach (the home  of the challenging chad), Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Houston or  Chicago. There are many additional choices. Availability for December  travel is as tight as the smile on a Supreme Court Justice's face, but we  should be able to get you what you need for the remaining months. Don't  miss out on a sale that can save you hundreds of dollars. Visit  http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898 and scroll to the applicabl e  headlines.   RT TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 THROUGH JUNE 15, 2001  They said it couldn't be done, but that's the kind of challenge we rise to  meet. The result--$328 roundtrip airfares from 40 U.S. cities to your  choice of 15 cities in the Caribbean for the 2001 peak winter travel  season. These fares can be 50 percent (or more) off standard published  fares. Think warm fun and island breezes in Cancun, St. Maarten, Aruba,  San Juan, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Montego Bay, Grand Cayman, Nassau and  four other Bahamas Islands. Golfers, how about Bermuda's extraordinary  courses? These fares are valid from over 40 U.S. cities starting at $328  roundtrip. Departure cities include New York City, Atlanta, Boston,  Buffalo, Philadelphia and Washington (DC). Our most expensive ticket  (still cheap) is from the West Coast, and it's only $458 roundtrip,  including Denver, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San  Francisco and Seattle. Visit  http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10088489.   RT BETWEEN 50 CENTRAL AND EAST COAST CITIES $198-218 THROUGH AUGUST 31  If you live in an expanded Central U.S. area that stretches from Texas to  Minnesota, in Atlanta, or in almost any major city to the east, fly to  dozens of destinations for $198-218 roundtrip. This deal includes New York  City, Boston, Myrtle Beach, many more southeast, southern and Texas cities  and over 50 cities in the Midwest. You can save up to 65 percent and lock  in sale fare travel through August 15, 2001. If you know where you'll be  heading for summer vacation, book now and cross one big planning problem  off your list.

Fly  just one roundtrip by December 31, 2000 and we will jump your TWA Aviators  frequent flyer status to elite level--a level that usually requires 25,000  airmiles in one year.

__label__1 I know that you will be at a management meeting the exact same time that this  conference is scheduled to take place, but I was hoping you could assign this task to someone else in  ENA Legal.  As you will note on the agenda attached below, we have placed the Legal Department at the top  of the agenda after the  introduction to discuss "Legal Implications of the Electronic Marketplace".  This discussion should conceivably include discussions of the following  topics:    Electronic signatures (in particular EnronOnline) Websites for delivery and executing confirmations (Commodity Logic) See "XIII Future Trends" on Page 4 of the agenda  Please let me know as soon as possible if this will be possible.  As you can  see, this is a very important topic for us.  Call me if I can help clarify any points.    One other point - I am assuming that you guys are the head guys for financial  and physical legal decision  making for Houston, Calgary and London.   For your information, there may be  some lawyer types coming from the London Global Markets group.  Also, JAD means Joint Accelerated Development. ---------------------- Forwarded by Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT on 10/19/2000 01:07 PM  ---------------------------   Enron Technology      cc:   Subject: agenda for the JAD session

All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.  As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.  On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.    Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.    As things change, we will continue to update you.

__label__3 Jill and Sara, Here is my proposed letter.  As a matter of course, Jill and I can continue to sign before it goes to commercial. Please let me know your comments. Thanks, Sheila           Subject:	Enron Corp  Sara and Marie, Andy Fastow authorized Ben Glisan and Tim Despain in June to withdraw funds from the Enron Corp Account at MSDW.    MSDW will accept a letter on company letterhead authorizing individuals to withdraw funds.  I can draft up something and have Andy sign it to authorize for Enron Corp.  We will also include Ben and Tim on the document for signatory examples.  As a matter of course, Jill and I have been signing before it goes to Andy.  Can we do this lettter instead of going the Corporate Secretary route to get it done?  It is not good that we currently have sole reliance on Andy being in the office to move funds out of the account.  Please advise. Sheila

__label__1 Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in  the PNM capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the  Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the  summer months.  The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to  consider our request.  In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of  our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're  doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our  request.  I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Commission's agenda.

__label__13 I'm a man trapped in a woman's body... not really, this is Jeff Fawcett in  Susan's office.  We're on a conference call with SoCalGas right now talking  about the settlement document.  Would you guys pull-up the attached file,  "Primary Rights 4-12.doc" and look it over, with particular reference to the  section titled, "Scheduling Priority?"  I think we're OK here, but I don't  want to agree to anything that we can't administer on our side of the meter  or that just doesn't make sense.  We're down to the final telecon on this subject, and all changes need to be  sent over to SoCalGas ASAP.  Will you take a quick look and send Susan a note  saying thumbs up or down?

__label__1 Joni, I was wondering if you could find out for me who the Marketer is for Post Rock Gas.  The reason I would like to know is they are the last hold-out shipper as far as signing their extension agreement so that we can send them their Rate Case Refund invoices which are dated September 1, 1999.  I would like to see if a Marketer could call them to see if we could get them to sign so that we could finally get the last of these invoices sent out and cleared from our accounts receivable account.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks,  Raetta
__label__13 I have revised the option form consistent (except where noted) with comments sent by Herman and Lisa, and have attached a redline version.  Herman, I dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little with the 1st paragraph.  I also construed your comment regarding Enron's right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty is in default.  Please confirm that this is acceptable.  Lisa, I did not change the notice info since the first entity will the the project co, with ENA Legal receiving a copy.    Please advise if you have any comments.  Kay

__label__13 Ken -   Good morning.    As a follow up to the voice mail that I left for you, following are some  background and preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between  Chancellor Reed and yourself.  Communications and indications from the UC/CSU  team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with  him on February 2, 2001.  As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting  on Tuesday, 2/20/01, all things are moving along well in California with our  clients, PG&E and SCE.  The current exception to the "smooth sailing" is  UC/CSU.  Tom Riley, the account manager for UC/CSU, has prepared the  following outline of business concerns, sequence of events and suggested  talking points.  Ken, thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this  client.  Regards - Dan    ****************************************************************************** ********************* Business Concerns  UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enron's action to De-DASR their  accounts.  They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that  would allow us to address them, but I have been able to surmise that they  consist of the following:  1.  UC/CSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access  customer.  AB-1X, recently signed by Gov. Davis, has ban language preventing  large commercial/industrial customers from going Direct Access.  Per Jeff  Dasovich of Enron Gov. Affairs, it is not clear, but possible, that if we had  not De-DASRed the accounts, that UC/CSU might have been grandfathered as a  direct access customer.  Further, SB-27X (still pending), which is Senator  Bowen's attempt to reverse the ban language of AB-1X, may have a financial  ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status.   Dasovich is investigating further.  2.  UC and CSU bought approximately 130 meters from Enron as we implemented  the contract.  Our action is forcing the utility to remove these  University-owned meters, meaning that their meters will become useless.  We  are currently using those meters to provide daily 15 minute interval data as  required in our contract. (Our operations and billing group have come up with  a transition plan that SCE has agreed to. SCE would install dual-sockets  allowing for the installation of the SCE meter, while keeping our meter in  tact, mitigating their concern.  At this point, UC and CSU are not listening  to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this  solution).  3.  We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling  coordinator (SC).  As a result of our action, we are no longer their SC.   They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their  recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program.    Sequence of Events  February 1 - I informed the UC/CSU electricity oversight board leaders and  contract administrators of Enron's decision.  I walked through the power  point presentation.  They expressed no concerns at that point, and even  expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract.  I sent the UC and  CSU contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our  decision.  February 2 - Ken Lay called Chancellor Reed assuring the Chancellor that we  will honor the contract.  I have since heard that this call was extremely  well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and  Ken's assurances that were communicated.  We offered the call to the UC  President as well, but were channeled to his SVP.  By the time I made contact  with the SVPs administrator, we had begun receiving letters (below), so I  backed off on arranging the call.  February 5 - UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been  speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications.   Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their  questions.    February 8/9 - UC and CSU send letters to their PG&E and SCE account managers  advising them they have concerns regarding Enron's decision, and that they  (PG&E and SCE) should only De-DASR on the Universities' request.  February 12 - I received a letter from the UC/CSU contract administers asking  for clarifications regarding our action, and requesting we re-DASR their  accounts.  February 14 - I responded with a letter providing them with responses to  their clarification questions, but did not offer to re-DASR their accounts as  they had requested.  February 16 - UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their  request to re-DASR and indicated they would be sending another letter.  I  suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses.  February 20 - CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending  outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay.  Throughout the entire process, I have been asking that the business  administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns.  I gather CSU  would like to do this, however, UC is more inclined to write letters and seek  legal remedies.    Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome   1.  We were faced with a difficult business decision, and made our California  decision with our customers in mind.  We have kept our contracts in tact.   Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers.  2.  We are an energy outsourcing company.  We should source supply from the  "best available" source in the marketplace. We feel we have a contractual  right to have made the decision.  3.  Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business  administrators to listen to and address their concerns.  We have not been  afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered.  However, the  Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to re-DASR their accounts  in the meantime.    I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired.  I can be reached at  925-543-3703 (office), or 925-548-0326 (mobile) if you have any questions.  Regards, Tom ****************************************************************************** *********************
__label__1 Hey. I had a question I wanted to ask you. I know you talked about taking the extra $10,000 you got and investing it for me. I was wondering if you were still going to do that or if you just took it and paid David. Even if you could give me the $4,000 left over after paying him $6,000 it would help. I'm kinda in a jam right now (between you and I) and I have some stuff I need to pay. I still owe Jay $5,500 for my car that he put on a credit card, and I have $4,000 of it, but if I give it all to him, that leaves me pretty broke. $27,000 of my money is stuck in my loan with the credit union, I paid mom like $2,000, paid off my credit, and have been making 2 car payments and 2 insurance payments since I still have the Neon. Even if you can only give me the $4,000 or even half of that...anything would help. I didn't know if you were still keeping that $10,000 for me or not, if you're not let me know. If you weren't, maybe you could lend me some money and I can pay you back...I'll be at work all day so E-Mail me back and let me know OK? Thanks. I love you. Ang

__label__1 They have not signed an EEI Master Power Purchase Agreement, or any master  agreement with us, and are under credit review. Our starting position with  this counterparty is that we will only accept changes to the EOL GTCs, as set  out in any EEI Master Power Purchase Agreement agreed with EPMI. Please head  off at the pass and save them any further unnecessary outside counsel legal  bills!  Regards  Marcus    Tana Jones@ECT 03/21/2001 03:22 PM   cc:  Subject: Virginia Electric & Power Company  I just received a phone call from Paul Varana, outside counsel to the  referenced counterparty.  His phone number is 713/752-4514.  He said that  VEPCO wasn't happy with the form of GTC attached to the physical online power  confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain  revisions.  He said the letter would come from Francine Matthews at VEPCO.  I  looked this counterparty up in my database, and it appears that we approved  them to trade physical power with an override letter.  Usually, we don't  allow any changes to the online GTC, but with physical power & the override  letters, I know there is some wiggle room.  I don't know how you want to  handle this, if you want to wait for the letter from VEPCO to come in and  then deal with the issues, or head him off at the pass.  Just let me know.

__label__1 Megan, James, and I met regarding the payment due Tenaska IV.  I am OK with  paying what is in the system right now.  However, I would like for all of us  to meet today regarding some accounting issues,  What is everyone's  availability for this afternoon?  Please let me know ASAP.      Daren J Farmer@ECT 12/12/2000 04:48 PM  Armstrong/HOU/ECT@ECT, Megan Parker/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jim  Pond/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: Tenaska IV 10/00  In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related  to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the  majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing  money to Tenaska IV.  I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the  calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached  schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay  this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do  this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in  the future.  Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.  Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.   Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we  reimburse Tenaska IV.  D ---------------------- Forwarded by Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT on 12/12/2000  04:37 PM ---------------------------  Enron North America Corp.      cc:   Subject: Tenaska IV 10/00  We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is  45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a  problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up  with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1  only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I  think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the  purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73  booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to  net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James  is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be  able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can  see the numbers.       Megan

__label__13 FYI      Subject:	RE: order problem  Hi Andy,  When it was decided that we would accept multi-day orders, we pointed out to Lavo and John that we do system maintenance for an hour every Friday night.  Their position was anytime we take the system down for any reason, planned or un-planned, we should kill all orders to prevent someone from being unable to cancel an order while the system was down and then having it fill before he can get to it.  We actually have a plan in place to make this much better.  Effectively, we will have dual sites.  The second site will be used both for disaster recovery, as well as a convenient way to manage code releases without an outage.  Unfortunately, purchasing the hardware for this has been put on hold given the present circumstances.  --jay      Subject:	order problem  Jay,  Have received comments that when multi day limit orders are placed, they are not alive after a friday night. I think this might have to do with orders getting wiped out duirng maintenance but I wanted to alert you to this.  AZ

__label__1 Hi Jeff,  Tim Hamilton asked me to give you my thoughts about the above mentioned  tariff.  1) SCHEDULE G-CFS-CORE FIRM STORAGE (page 1 of 1)  * How will PG&E implement the storage charge - will they retro this to April  2000? * Is the storage rate applicable to our monthly storage inventory or monthly  storage capacity? Our monthly storage inventory is about 300,000 dth and monthly storage  capactity is about 4,000 dth. 300,00dth X $0.10 = $30,000/month 4,000 dth X $0.10 = $400/month  2) RULE 14 - CAPACITY ALLOCATION AND CONSTRAINT OF NATURAL GAS SERVICE (page  11 of 18) OFO NONCOMPLIANCE CHARGE EXEMPTION:  * The $1,000 per month exemption gives the small guy the right to be  non-compliant.    3) SCHEDULE G-BAL-GAS BALANCING SERVICE FOR INTRASTATE TRANSPORTATION  CUSTOMERS (page 7 of 11) SELF BALANCING OPTION:  * The Self-Balancing credit of $0.005/dth is a good concept but we could not  take advantage of that because our usage fluctuates too much from   day to  day.

__label__1 FYI      Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance   November 25, 2001  Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season, Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances left on the system.  Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2 Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city- gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account Manager.     *******************************************************************  NOTE:  Duke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.

__label__1 Tana,  These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.     Thanks,  Patrick       Subject:	RE: Riskmantra vs. EGM  Patrick,  Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?       Subject:	RE: Riskmantra vs. EGM  I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.  Bill       Subject:	FW: Riskmantra vs. EGM  Here is a list of all the trades with EGM.  Thanks,  Patrick  Financial Confirmations 53877   << File: export.csv >>        Subject:	FW: Riskmantra vs. EGM   I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.

Subject:	FW: Riskmantra vs. EGM   Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't?      Subject:	FW: Riskmantra vs. EGM  Tana,  I was just following about these trades.       Subject:	Riskmantra vs. EGM  Tana,  There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?  Thanks,  Patrick

__label__9 This past weekend was the MS 150 bike tour from Houston to Austin.  This was my third year riding in the event, and it keeps getting better every year.    We started out bright and early on Saturday morning with some 9,500 other riders eager to make the 175 mile trip to Austin.  Team Enron was first out of the gate again this year.  The course was more congested than last year because of the huge increase in ridership.  The event has been growing 20 percent each year.  The crowd started to thin out after about 15 miles, and it was smooth sailing until lunch in Bellville.  After a quick sandwich, I was on my way again to LaGrange.  There were a few more hills this year than last, and the wind started to pick up towards the end.  Visions of a cold Miller Lite and a relaxing message inspired me onward.  I arrived in LaGrange about 1:15, plenty of time to shower and relax in the tent before Enron's famous barbecue dinner.  The next morning, we awoke bright and early to the call to the MS Society's pancake breakfast.  Getting up at 5am and back on your bike after having ridden 100 miles the previous day was no fun task, but everything was fine after about 10 miles.  Sunday morning was fairly uneventful until the infamous Bastrop State Park with its killer hills.  After the park was lunch, then the homestretch to Austin.  This year we had a nice tailwind to help us along.      Last year, with the support of people like you, the Texas MS society raised over $3.5 million for multiple sclerosis research.  This year, we will certainly break through that goal. Each of us probably know at least one person touched by this terrible disease, and this money goes a long way towards finding a cure.    If I haven't already collected your pledge, I'd appreciate it if you'd drop it by.  For those of you not on 45, I'll stop by your floor sometime next week.  Thank you for your support!

__label__3 Shelley, did you still want a reserved parking space?  I'm sure there are plenty, but the rate has increased $10. per month to $175. total monthly charge.  Let me know, I'm sure there are plenty available.  Thank you, Ricki      Subject:	Bus Pass and Parking Information   FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp  Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.    For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.    Direct parking costs to employees are as follows: Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	 Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	 Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	 Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	 Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	 Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	   Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.

__label__7 The disclosure proposed for the 3rd Quarter Noteholders' report is the exact  same wording as was used in the 2nd Qtr Noteholders' Report and is consistent  with the language and level of detail insisted upon by AA and used in the  1999 NNG Audited Financial Statements (Brown Cover Report).  Although AA has  no say in what we include in the Noteholders Reports, I believe our Offering  Circulars require that we use GAAP for interim financial reports, even though  they are unaudited.

__label__1 Thanks for this note Lou  - I will making a special effort to recommunicate  this to the wider Metals group in London     Louis Colarusso@MGUSA 15/02/2001 16:28  Charlotte McKinty/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sean Connor/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike  Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Andrew Cornfield/LON/ECT@ECT, Marcelo  Parra/NYC/MGUSA@MGUSA cc:    Subject: SAP Implementation  After a successful period 1 close by 1041 and 1123 I wanted to summarize the  positives and negatives of the project in order to improve the process for  the London Metals implementation.  Positives:  Seamless consolidation process with Enron worldwide  Common design allows users in North America to access key financial data to  help control London Metals business accounts receivable accounts payable  Aging of accounts receivable for proper control monitoring  Profit Center report functionality for controlling of business by business  group  Timing of close process in conjunction with Enron worldwide  Cost center control by category link by design to corresponding profit center  Cash control procedures utilizing the Treasury Work Station of Enron Corp.  Direct posting of intercompany accounts to reduce duplicate entries  Production of the Daily Profit Report direct from SAP utilizing the  consolidation ledger  SAP trail balance controlled by the ledger owner agrees with the DPR by  profit center  Negatives:  FIT 3 testing should be expanded in order to identify all types of business  flows and to evaluate how they are being treated in SAP.  NY did a two day  roll forward of equity which proved useful.  This type of testing could be  expanded for the London companies.  Poor links of information between GCP system and TWS created many manual  payments. This problem is being sorted out by a process outside the SAP implementation  team.  Strict intercompany common design rules around intercompany relationships  have created a difficult control environment. SAP intercompany meetings are being conducted to create a system that  adheres to the common design   however allows better intercompany control  features between broker and physical company.  A special thanks goes out to the SAP team who's continued dedication on this  project has made it a success:  Charlotte McKinty Craig Brown Rayees Moizuddin Sean Connor   Regards,  Louis Colarusso Enron Metals & Commodity Corp E-Mail: louis.colarusso@enron.com

Most companies such  as Petro-Canada and Paramount Resources  are pressing ahead with  exploration in the rugged Northwest Territories. Due to marshy  conditions for the rest of the year, wells are drilled in winter when  the ground freezes. Petro-Canada plans to drill three 9,840-foot deep  wells in the Mackenzie Delta and Paramount intends to drill two wells  farther south, near Fort Liard, below the Arctic Circle. The region  could hold trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. In recent  federally supervised land sales, producers committed to spending  C$650 million on exploration over the next few years just in the  Mackenzie Delta. But some wells in theYukon and the Northwest  Territories' central Mackenzie Valley have been canceled or delayed  by Canadian Natural Resources. But the troubled economy and the drop  in prices from $10 per MMBtu last January are having an impact. Akita  Drilling is keeping two new rigs in Alberta this winter and delaying  the move of the C$18 million units to the Mackenzie Delta until later  in 2002. Imperial Oil, Shell Canada and Conoco are studying building  a C$3 billion pipeline to transport about a Bcf per day of Arctic  volumes to southern Canada and the US.

Lamadrid/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Tate/HOU/EES@EES, Robert Superty/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Greif/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Stephanie Miller/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Dominion 637  FYI.   (DTI is obviously what they are calling Dominion these days.)  ---------------------- Forwarded by Rebecca W Cantrell/HOU/ECT on 12/06/2000  03:39 PM ---------------------------   "Randall Rich" <rrich@bracepatt.com> on 12/06/2000 08:19:48 AM  cc:   Subject: DTI 637   We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:  DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of  customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the  imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a  new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities  that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.
__label__13 Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side: I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times  there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency  power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would  want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to  replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get  this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).   I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you. Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting  transmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its  network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have  to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the  plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to  supply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin  Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's  network transmission to delivery to third parties. Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent  rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While  VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that  you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to  transmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only  way to ensure deliverability to third parties. 3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an  increase.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other  sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission  and subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on  best/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase  daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of  receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as  non-firm.) 12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that  has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since  FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant  changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining  transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this  contract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price  covers that circumstance. Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at  most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any  current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will  pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this  contract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.      Tom Chapman 06/13/2000 06:07 PM  cc:   Subject: VEPCO PPA  Christi--  This is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively  early draft of the PPA.  I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and  do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.   IN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up  the regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue  less contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at  Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.    Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their  gas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas  from the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the  NCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think  that we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply  working on some of the siting issues.  That being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or  Jeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there  are some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.    Thanks.

In preparing the draft, we did  encounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are  noted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and  are also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this  goes to VEPCO.  Cover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be  ENA or a special purpose company?  Definitions--  We included a defined term "Emergency Start-Up" (a start up or  increase in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to  include a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.  Section 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy  charge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?  Section 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD  will be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also,  it would be best to define "commencement of construction" to avoid  controversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a  placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is  your preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific  remedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that  milestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would  be a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90  days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the  cure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?  Section 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under  this PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement  to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the  Facility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take  1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be  pro-rated for the first year?  Section 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of  Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the  total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated  that the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other  than due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled  maintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be  available.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated  that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why  wouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we  included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during  peak periods.  Section 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of  Energy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we  allow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?  Section 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.  Section 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?  Article 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not  have any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do  you want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for  now?  Section 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or  would you prefer a shorter period?  Article 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step  prior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is  "baseball" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's  position or the other's.  Is that what you want?  Section 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it  will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not  recommend Virginia law for this contract.  Exhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please  see the bracketed notes therein.  Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.  - VEPPPA.DOC

My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests,  Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've made a few small changes: Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea.  The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.  Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it is a turkey.  We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them.  They are lying. We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.  We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.   In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table.  In a separate room.  Next door.  Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.  I stress "private", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances, enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.  I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that "passing the rolls" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance.  Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it.   Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably won't come next year either.    I am thankful.

Every day in your community there are single parents struggling to make ends meet and wondering where the money will come from to cover their children's basic expenses.  Most of these parents are hard working people who just need help from the person who has a legal responsibility to give it to them.  Every day a large number of parents call us for help in collecting their child support.    Many more than we can possibly handle.  We need the help of caring and dedicated people who would like to enter a new high paying prestigious profession.  The court has decided how much these parents are to receive but the caseloads are so large that the results are that there is over  $32 Billion dollars worth of uncollected Child Support in the US today   and this amount grows by millions every week.   If you would be interested in helping us, then  we have all of the training that you will need to start a new business in this high growth profession of "Child Support Processing!"    We have the resources available to you to help you track down deadbeat parents and force them to pay what they legally owe, without ever having to come into contact with them!  We have the most extensive Computer Data Bases in the world for the processing of Child Support.   Our databases allow you to track down dead beats, find their assets and then collect the child support, which is due.  These powerful databases will be available to you if you choose to join us. You can do what private investigators do, legally, and for a fraction of what it would normally cost! And you can do it from the comfort of your own home office!   More details about our Child Support Collection Course: Child Support Collection has reached epidemic proportions, $32 billion nationally  ; state agencies are simply too understaffed!  State agencies are typically very happy when we assist a parent.  We find the dead beat and their assets and the state agencies are pleased to use their government powers, working with us, to collect the back child support.  Our Child Support Collection course teaches you to how locate the DEAD-BEAT parent, their assets, employment, bank accounts and how to collect on those assets.   The manual supplies the forms, brochures, and child support business methodology.  We also have the most powerful reporting capabilities at your disposal to help you track down dead-beat parents.  Unpaid child support is an epidemic . . . and you can be the cure!   As our national and local media remind us every day, millions of custodial parents are struggling to raise their families without the child support to which they are entitled. In fact, you or someone you know is probably tackling this problem right now.  This Child Support Collection Course teaches you to recover your own child support payments. Or you can learn to help others in need, earning about 25% to 30% of what is collected.  That translates to $4,000 . . . $8,000 . . .even $12,000 earned each month collecting for others! You'd be hard-pressed to come up with any other legal business opportunity that allows you to earn such a significant income while performing such a valuable community service.   Not only do you have the potential to make thousands of dollars a month recovering delinquent child support payments, you'll also "earn" the gratitude of custodial parents and their children who are finally receiving the money they're due!  You might be thinking a successful child support recovery business would require a difficult time commitment or a lot of expensive equipment. Not at all! You can make thousands of dollars each month, part-time or full-time, working from your home, with only a telephone and a home computer!  This course places you at the leading edge of a major national trend, namely, privatizing the recovery of delinquent child support payments. Whereas the government succeeds only one fifth of the time in this area, well-trained private parties are doing four times better!  And remember every time you recover a payment, you can earn 25% to 30% of what you find!  We provide step by step instructions for you to follow, enabling you to collect all back-owed child support for yourself or anyone else you choose. It is not necessary to have in-depth legal knowledge or even a college education.   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, absent parents in the United States have a big bill to pay: $32 billion in delinquent child support payments. That is over 15 million cases, with 1.5 million new cases added every year. More than half of court-ordered child support cases become delinquent at some time, and in more than one fourth of cases, no payments are ever made.  Children deserve and need the support they have been awarded, but government agencies aren't offering any real help because they are totally over whelmed. In fact, the agencies are so flooded with requests that they only collect about 18% of the child support money they go after. In other words, the government typically has an 82% failure rate! No private business could survive with that kind of record, and the impact on children can be devastating.  Statistics show that after a divorce, an absent parent's available income goes up 43%, while the custodial parent's spending money goes down 20%.  With your help, children in need have a four-times-greater chance of receiving the money they are due than if they relied on the government for recovery.   One mother has told us that working with the government to find an absent parent "is like beating your head against a brick wall. The frustration and futility you feel are enormous. Agencies crawl at a snails pace, and authorities often lose files or seem to make no progress with a case." But this same mother's outlook changed  after reviewing our course: "I would have given anything to have this knowledge years ago. This is the best $249.00 I have ever spent."

__label__7 Can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues I  raised last week? If you can do it tomorrow, let me know what times you are not available and  I'll schedule something around them.  Thanks.
__label__11 i couldn't read.  i have never danced for 5 hours straight.  it was epic.   how is it to visit there.  it seemed like a very nice place to check out.   nothing else is really going on just trying to get an idea of what to do this  weekend.  i got some good pics in jamaica.
__label__11 that's not fair.  actually i am not far behind you.  try not to be hungover tomorrow.      Subject:	RE: Mark Report
__label__5 That is correct only Australian Power and Weather     cc:    Subject: Re: RUSH APPROVAL-Australia + Japan Weather    David,  A clarification...  On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they  should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other  products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally  and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a  correct interpretation?

The list for Australian weather is  fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral  requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we  do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These  are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not  linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading  Australian power and weather.  Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and  weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to  trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to  check this one out further.

From the  US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for  power.

__label__1 John:  Thanks for the e-mail.  I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this "loss" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are "positions" that should be "owned" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?  Andy         Subject:	  Andy  With respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.  I think he is doing a great job and showing a great deal of integrity in trying to get the best deal for Enron.  Let me know if you disagree.   John
